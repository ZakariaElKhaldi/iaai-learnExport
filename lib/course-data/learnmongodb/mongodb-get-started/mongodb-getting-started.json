      "content": "MongoDB\nMongoDB is a document database and can be installed locally or hosted in the cloud.\nSQL vs Document Databases\nSQL databases are considered relational databases.\nThey store related data in separate tables.\nWhen data is needed, it is queried from multiple tables to join the data back together.\nMongoDB is a document database which is often referred to as a non-relational database.\nThis does not mean that relational data cannot be stored in document databases.\nIt means that relational data is stored differently.\nA better way to refer to it is as a non-tabular database.\nMongoDB stores data in flexible documents.\nInstead of having multiple tables you can simply keep all of your related data together.\nThis makes reading your data very fast.\nYou can still have multiple groups of data too. In MongoDB, instead of tables these are called collections.\nLocal vs Cloud Database\nMongoDB can be installed locally, which will allow you to host your own MongoDB server on your hardware.\nThis requires you to manage your server, upgrades, and any other maintenance.\nYou can download and use the MongoDB open source\nCommunity Server\non your hardware for free.\nHowever, for this course we are going to use MongoDB Atlas, a cloud database platform.\nThis is much easier than hosting your own local database.\nTo be able to experiment with the code examples, you will need access to a MongoDB database.\n\nMongoDB Atlas\naccount to get started.\nCreating a Cluster\nAfter you have created your account, set up a free \"Shared Cluster\" then choose your preferred cloud provider and region.\nBy default, MongoDB Atlas is completely locked down and has no external access.\nYou will need to set up a user and add your IP address to the list of allowed IP addresses.\nUnder \"Database Access\", create a new user and keep track of the username and password.\n\nInstall MongoDB Shell (mongosh)\nThere are many ways to connect to your MongoDB database.\nWe will start by using the MongoDB Shell,\nmongosh\n.\nUse the\nofficial instructions\nto install\nmongosh\non your operating system.\nTo verify that it has been installed properly, open your terminal and type:\nmongosh --version\nYou should see that the latest version is installed.\nThe version used in this tutorial is v1.3.1.\nConnect to the database\nTo connect to your database, you will need your database specific connection string.\nIn the MongoDB Atlas dashboard, under \"Databases\", click the \"Connect\" button for your Cluster.\n\nCopy your connection string.\nExample\nYour connection string should look similar to this:\nmongosh \"mongodb+srv://cluster0.ex4ht.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase\" --apiVersion 1 --username YOUR_USER_NAME\n\nPaste your connection string into your terminal and press enter.\nYou will be prompted to enter your database user password that you created earlier.\nYou are now connected to the database!\nWhat \nIn the following sections we will use 'mongosh' to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) items in your database.\nAfter getting the basics down, we will move on to using MongoDB with other backend technologies like Node.js.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
