If left empty, all documents will be returned.\nExample\ndb.posts.find()\n\nfindOne()\nTo select only one document, we can use the\nfindOne()\nmethod.\nThis method accepts a query object. If left empty, it will return the first document it finds.\nNote:\nThis method only returns the first match it finds.\nExample\ndb.posts.findOne()\n\nQuerying Data\nTo query, or filter, data we can include a query in our\nfind()\nor\nfindOne()\nmethods.\nExample\ndb.posts.find( {category: \"News\"} )\n\nProjection\nBoth find methods accept a second parameter called\nprojection\n.\nThis parameter is an\nobject\nthat describes which fields to include in the results.\nNote:\nThis parameter is optional. If omitted, all fields will be included in the results.\nExample\nThis example will only display the\ntitle\nand\ndate\nfields in the results.\ndb.posts.find({}, {title: 1, date: 1})\n\nNotice that the\n_id\nfield is also included. This field is always included unless specifically excluded.\nWe use a\n1\nto include a field and\n0\nto exclude a field.\nExample\nThis time, let's exclude the\n_id\nfield.\ndb.posts.find({}, {_id: 0, title: 1, date: 1})\n\nNote:\nYou cannot use both 0 and 1 in the same object.\nThe only exception is the\n_id\nfield. \nYou should either specify the fields you would like to include or the fields you would like to exclude.\nLet's exclude the date category field. All other fields will be included in the results.\nExample\ndb.posts.find({}, {category: 0})\n\nWe will get an error if we try to specify both 0 and 1 in the same object.\nExample\ndb.posts.find({}, {title: 1, date: 0})\n\n\u2605\n+1",
