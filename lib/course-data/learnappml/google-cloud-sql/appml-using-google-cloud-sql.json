      "content": "Google Cloud SQL is a database cloud service.\nIt is easy to set up and manage.\nIt is FREE to try!\nWhat is Google Cloud SQL\nGoogle Cloud SQL is a cloud based database service.\nWhy use Google Cloud SQL?\nGoogle Cloud SQL offers MySQL databases deployed in the cloud without a fuss.\nGoogle offers powerful databases that run fast, and flexible charging (pay \nper use).\nGoogle manages automated backups, patching, and recovery.\nGetting Started\nBefore you can start using Google Cloud SQL, you need a Google account, and \nGoogle Developers Console.\nIf you do not have a Google account you can \nCreate your Google \nAccount\n\nWhen you \nautomatically signed up for all services in Google Cloud, including SQL.\nIf you are a new Cloud Platform user, you can get started with a trial period \nfor free.\nThe Cloud Platform free trial allows you to try Cloud SQL for free for 60 \ndays. \nFor more information, see\nCloud Platform \nFree Trial\n.\nIf you decide to continue with Cloud Platform after your free period (or if you need \nmore storage or performance than the free usage tier offers), you only pay for the resources you use.\nTo create an Google Developers Console account\n\ngo to:\nhttps://console.developers.google.com/freetrial\n, and follow the on-screen \ninstructions.\nCreate a MySQL Database Instance\nIn this example we will set up a Database instance running MySQL.\nCreate a MySQL DB instance:\nOnce you have created your account Google will automatically create a \n    new project for you called \"My First Project\". In this example we will just \n    use that project.\nIn the menu, click \"Storage\", and then \"Cloud SQL\"\nClick \"Create an instance\"\nOn the \"Create Cloud SQL instance\" page select a name, region and \n    performance tier for your DB instance. In this example we will skip the \n    advanced options.\nClick \"Create\"\nThe new DB instance appears in the list of DB instances (when it has the \n    status \"Runnable\" it is ready for use)\nClick on the name of the instance, and click \"Access Control\" on the \n    navigation pane\nClick \"IP address\" in the sub-navigation pane, and click the \"Request \n    IPv4 address\" button\nKeep this IP address, as it will be the IP address you use to connect to \n    your database\nClick \"Users\" in the sub-navigation pane, and click the \"New user\" \n    button\nSpecify a username and password for your database\nClick \"Authorization\" in the sub-navigation pane, and click the \"+ Add \n    item\" button under Allowed Networks\nHere you can specify who has access to your database, It can be:\nYour own IP, or the IP of your server. This way only you have access \n        to your database\nor 0.0.0.0/0, which allows all external IP addresses to connect \n        (this can be a security risk, and cause extra costs)\nClick \"Save\"\nClick \"Databases\" in the navigation pane, and click the \"New database\" \n    button\nSpecify a name for your database (you can leave the other options as \n    they are unless you have specific requirements)\nNow you have a Google Cloud SQL database, with an IP that you can connect to.\nConfigure Database Connection in AppML\nTo configure the database connection, edit the appml_config file:\nPHP example: appml_config.php\n<?php echo(\"Access Forbidden\");exit();?>\n{\n\"dateformat\" : \n    \"yyyy-mm-dd\",\n\"databases\" : [{\n\"connection\" : \"\nmydatabase\n\",\n\"host\" : \"\nyourDatabaseURL\n\",\n\"dbname\" : \"\nyourDatabaseName\n\",\n\"username\" : \"\nyourUserName\n\",\n\"password\" : \"\nyourPassword\n\"\n}]\n}\nEdit the following:\nmydatabase\n- change to whatever you want the database \n    connection to be called in your application\nyourDatabaseURL\n- change to the IP from the \n    step, and add the port 3306 (like this\n192.168.1.1\n:3306)\nyourDatabaseName\n- change to the name of your \n    database instance in Google Cloud SQL\nyourUserName\n- change to the username you specified for your \n    database in Google Cloud SQL\nyourPassword\n- change to the password you specified for your \n    database in Google Cloud SQL\nAppML should now be configured to connect to your Google Cloud SQL database.\nYou can now fill your database with data:\nIf you have access to a PHP server, this is described in the\nAppML PHP chapter\nIf you have access to an ASP.NET server, this is described in the\nAppML .NET chapter\n\n\u2605\n+1",
