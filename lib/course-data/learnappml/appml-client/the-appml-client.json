We have used W3.CSS in our examples.\nAppML Web Applications\nAppML is extremely efficient for building web applications.\nOne of the most powerful features is the ability to develop prototype applications in the \nweb browser, including database CRUD applications, without the need of any web \nserver.\nCRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete.\nAppML Server\nAppML comes with two server scripts (PHP and .NET) designed to provide server data.\nWith AppML server scripts, you can easily access SQL databases, like mySQL and SQL server.\nThe server scripts are very powerful, and can easily be installed on any \nPHP or .NET server.\nAppML Web SQL\nIn addition, for rapid application development and prototyping, AppML can \nalso simulate a web server in the browser, using Web SQL.\nWeb SQL is a web page API for storing data in the browser using SQL. The API \nis supported by Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, and the Android Browser.\nJust add the following script to your web page:\n<script src=\"https://www..com/appml/2.0.3/appml_sql.js\"></script>\n\n\u2605\n+1",
