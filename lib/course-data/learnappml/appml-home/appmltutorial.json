It is descriptive language (a language for describing applications).\nIt is built around familiar Web application concepts like:\nForms\nLists\nReports\nFilters\nFunctions\nDatabases\nAppML runs in any HTML page. No installation is required.\nAppML is a tool for bringing data to HTML applications:\nFrom Objects\nFrom JSON files\nFrom Text files\nFrom XML files\nFrom databases\nObjects\nJSON Files\nText Files\nXML Files\nPHP/MySQL\nWhy AppML?\nHTML is not very suitable for describing web applications.\nAppML is made for web applications:\nAppML extends HTML with data\nattributes.\nAppML adds\ncontrollers\nto HTML, to control the behavior of \nHTML data.\nAppML is very easy to understand and extraordinarily quick to develop.\nAppML Example\nThis example shows how easy AppML can bring data to HTML:\nAppML Example\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en-US\">\n<title>Customers</title>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\">\n<script src=\"https://www..com/appml/2.0.3/appml.js\"></script>\n<body>\n<h1>Customers</h1>\n<table appml-data=\"customers.js\">\n<tr>\n<th>Customer</th>\n<th>City</th>\n<th>Country</th>\n</tr>\n<tr appml-repeat=\"records\">\n<td>{{CustomerName}}</td>\n<td>{{City}}</td>\n<td>{{Country}}</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n</html>\n\nAppML is a tool for easy, rapid, and agile web application development.\nEasy and Agile\nOn today's market, there are many frameworks (tools or libraries) designed to \nextend HTML.\nMost of these frameworks manipulate HTML, CSS or JavaScript in a way that \nmakes them difficult to use (especially when used in combination).\nAppML is different. You have \nfull HTML, CSS, and JavaScript freedom.\nAppML makes it easy to create Single Page Applications (SPA) in a very clean \nand efficient way.\nEven if you have never worked with web development before, you will find AppML \nvery easy to use.\nIf you are an experienced web developer, you will soon discover \nthe power of AppML.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
