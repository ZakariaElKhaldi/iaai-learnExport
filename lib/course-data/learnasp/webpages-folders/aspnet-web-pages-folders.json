      "content": "This chapter is about folders and folder paths.\nIn this chapter you will learn:\nAbout Logical and Physical folder structures\nAbout Virtual and Physical names\nAbout web URLs and Paths\nLogical Folder Structure\nBelow is a typical folder structure for an ASP.NET web pages web site:\nThe \"Account\" folder contains logon and security files\nThe \"App_Data\" folder contains databases and data files\nThe \"Images\" folder contains images\nThe \"Scripts\" folder contains browser scripts\nThe \"Shared\" folder contains common files (like layout and style files)\nPhysical Folder Structure\nThe physical  \nstructure for the \"Images\" folder at the website above might look like this on a computer:\nC:\\Johnny\\Documents\\MyWebSites\\Demo\\Images\nVirtual and Physical Names\nFrom the example above:\nThe virtual name of a web picture might be \"Images/pic31.jpg\".\nBut the physical name is \"C:\\Johnny\\Documents\\MyWebSites\\Demo\\Images\\pic31.jpg\"\nURLs and Paths\nURLs are used to access files from the web:\n\nThe URL corresponds \nto a physical file on a server: C:\\MyWebSites\\\\html\\html5_intro.asp\nA virtual \npath is shorthand to represent physical paths. If you use virtual paths, you can move your \npages to a different domain \n(or server) without having to update the paths.\nURL\n\nServer name\n\nVirtual path\n/html/html5_intro.asp\nPhysical path\nC:\\MyWebSites\\\\html\\html5_intro.asp\nThe root on a disk drive is written like C:\\, but the root on a web site is\u00a0 / \n(forward slash).\nThe virtual path of a \nweb folder is (almost) never the same as the physical folder.\nIn your code you will, reference both the physical path and the virtual path, depending on what \nyou are coding.\nASP.NET has 3 tools for working with folder paths: the ~ operator, the Server.MapPath method, \nand the Href method.\nThe ~ Operator\nTo specify the virtual root in programming code, use the ~ operator.\nIf you use the ~ operator, instead of a path, you can move your website to a different folder or \nlocation without changing any code:\nvar myImagesFolder = \"~/images\";\nvar myStyleSheet = \"~/styles/StyleSheet.css\";\nThe \nServer.MapPath Method\nThe Server.MapPath method converts a virtual path (/default.cshtml) to a \nphysical path that the server can understand (C:\\Johnny\\MyWebSited\\Demo\\default.cshtml).\nYou will use this method when you need to open data \nfiles located on the server (data files can only be accessed with a full \nphysical path):\nvar pathName = \"~/dataFile.txt\";\nvar fileName = Server.MapPath(pathName);\nYou will learn more about reading from (and writing to) data files on the server in \nthe \nThe Href Method\nThe Href method converts a path used in the code to a path that the browser \ncan understand (the browser cannot understand the ~ operator).\nYou use the Href method to create paths to resources like image files, and CSS files.\nYou will often use this method in HTML \n<a>, <img>, and <link> elements:\n@{var myStyleSheet = \"~/Shared/Site.css\";}\n<!-- This creates a link \nto the CSS file. -->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"@Href(myStyleSheet)\" \n/>\n<!-- Same as : -->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/Shared/Site.css\" \n/>\nThe Href method is a method of the WebPage Object.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
