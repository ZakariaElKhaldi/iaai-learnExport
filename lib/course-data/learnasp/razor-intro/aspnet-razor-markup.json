      "content": "Razor is not a programming language. It's a server side markup language.\nWhat is Razor?\nRazor is a markup syntax that \nlets you embed server-based code (Visual Basic and C#) into web pages.\nServer-based code can create dynamic web content on the fly, while a web page \nis written to the browser. When a web page is called, the server executes the \nserver-based code inside the page before it returns the page to the browser. By \nrunning on the server, the code can perform complex tasks, like accessing \ndatabases.\nRazor is based \non ASP.NET, and designed \nfor creating web applications. It has the power of traditional ASP.NET markup, \nbut it is easier to use, and easier to learn.\nRazor Syntax\nRazor uses a syntax very similar to PHP and Classic ASP.\nRazor:\n<ul>\n@for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n<li>@i</li>\n}\n</ul>\nPHP:\n<ul>\n<?php\nfor ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {\necho(\"<li>$i</li>\");\n}\n?>\n</ul>\nClassic ASP:\n<ul>\n<%for i = 0 to 10%>\n<li><%=i%></li>\n<%\n</ul>\nRazor Helpers\nASP.NET helpers are components that can be accessed by single lines of \nRazor code.\nYou can build your own helpers using Razor syntax, or \nuse built-in ASP.NET helpers.\nBelow is a short description of some useful Razor helpers:\nWeb Grid\nWeb Graphics\nGoogle Analytics\nFacebook Integration\nTwitter \nIntegration\nSending Email\nValidation\nRazor Programming Languages\nRazor supports both C# (C sharp) and VB (Visual Basic).\n\n\u2605\n+1",
