A \n    variable value is uninitialized when it is first created and no value is \n    assigned to it, or when a variable value is explicitly set to empty.\nExample:\nDim x\u00a0\u00a0 \n    'the variable x is uninitialized!\nx=\"ff\"\u00a0\u00a0 'the variable x is NOT uninitialized anymore\nx=Empty\u00a0\u00a0 'the variable x is uninitialized!\nNote:\nThis is not the same as Null!!\nIsEmpty\nUsed to test if a variable is uninitialized.\nExample: If (IsEmpty(x)) 'is x uninitialized?\nNothing\nUsed to indicate an uninitialized object value, or to \n    disassociate an object variable from an object to release system resources.\nExample: \n    Set myObject=Nothing\nIs Nothing\nUsed to test if a value is an initialized object.\nExample: If (myObject Is Nothing) 'is it unset?\nNote:\nIf you compare a value to Nothing, you will not get the \n    right result! Example: If (myObject = Nothing) 'always false!\nNull\nUsed to indicate that a variable contains no valid data.\nOne way to think of Null is that someone has explicitly set the value to \n    \"invalid\", unlike Empty where the value is \"not set\".\nNote:\nThis is not the same as Empty or Nothing!!\nExample: x=Null 'x contains no valid data\nIsNull\nUsed to test if a value contains invalid data.\nExample: if (IsNull(x)) 'is x invalid?\nTrue\nUsed to indicate a Boolean condition that is correct\nFalse\nUsed to indicate a Boolean condition that is not correct (False has a value of 0)\n\n\u2605\n+1",
