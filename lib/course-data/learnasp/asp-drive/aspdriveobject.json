For this purpose you will have to use the Folder object.\nTo work with the properties of the Drive object, you will have to create an \ninstance of the Drive object through the FileSystemObject\nobject. First; create a FileSystemObject object and then instantiate the Drive object \nthrough the GetDrive method or\nthe Drives property of the FileSystemObject object.\nThe Drive object's properties are described below:\nProperties\nProperty\nDescription\nAvailableSpace\nReturns the amount of available space to a user on a\n      specified drive or network share\nDriveLetter\nReturns one uppercase letter that identifies the local\n      drive or a network share\nDriveType\nReturns the type of a specified drive\nFileSystem\nReturns the file system in use for a specified drive\nFreeSpace\nReturns the amount of free space to a user on a\n      specified drive or network share\nIsReady\nReturns true if the specified drive is ready and false if\n      not\nPath\nReturns an uppercase letter followed by a colon that\n      indicates the path name for a specified drive\nRootFolder\nReturns a Folder object that represents the root folder of a specified\n      drive\nSerialNumber\nReturns the serial number of a specified drive\nShareName\nReturns the network share name for a specified drive\nTotalSize\nReturns the total size of a specified drive or network\n      share\nVolumeName\nSets or returns the volume name of a specified drive\n\n\u2605\n+1",
