A\nDSN-less connection can be used against any Microsoft Access database on your web site.\nIf you have a database called \"northwind.mdb\" located in a web\ndirectory like \"c:/webdata/\",\nyou can connect to the database with the following ASP code:\n<%\nset conn=Server.CreateObject(\"ADODB.Connection\")\nconn.Provider=\"Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0\"\nconn.Open \"c:/webdata/northwind.mdb\"\n%>\nNote, from the example above, that you have to specify the Microsoft Access\ndatabase driver (Provider) and the physical path to the database on your\ncomputer.\nCreate an ODBC Database Connection\nIf you have an ODBC database called \"northwind\" you can connect to the database with the following\nASP code:\n<%\nset conn=Server.CreateObject(\"ADODB.Connection\")\nconn.Open \"northwind\"\n%>\nWith an ODBC connection, you can connect to any database, on any computer in\nyour network, as long as an ODBC connection is available.\nAn ODBC Connection to an MS Access Database\nHere is how to create a connection to a MS Access Database:\nOpen the\nODBC\nicon in your Control Panel.\nChoose the\nSystem DSN\ntab.\nClick on\nAdd\nin the System DSN tab.\nSelect\nthe Microsoft Access Driver.
