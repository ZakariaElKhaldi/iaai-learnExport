A cookie is a small file that the server\nembeds on the user's computer. Each time the same computer requests a page with a browser, it will send the cookie\ntoo. With ASP, you can both create and retrieve cookie values.\nHow to Create a Cookie?\nThe \"Response.Cookies\" command is used to create cookies.\nNote:\nThe Response.Cookies command must appear BEFORE the <html> tag.\nIn the example below, we will create a cookie named \"firstname\" and assign the value \"Alex\" to it:\n<%\nResponse.Cookies(\"firstname\")=\"Alex\"\n%>\nIt is also possible to assign properties to a cookie, like setting a date when the cookie should expire:\n<%\nResponse.Cookies(\"firstname\")=\"Alex\"\nResponse.Cookies(\"firstname\").Expires=#May 10,2012#\n%>\nHow to Retrieve a Cookie Value?\nThe \"Request.Cookies\" command is used to retrieve a cookie value.\nIn the example below, we retrieve the value of the cookie named \"firstname\" and display it on a page:\n<%\nfname=Request.Cookies(\"firstname\")\nresponse.write(\"Firstname=\" & fname)\n%>\nOutput:\nFirstname=Alex\nA Cookie with Keys\nIf a cookie contains a collection of multiple values, we say that the cookie has Keys.\nIn the example below, we will create a cookie collection named \"user\".\nThe \"user\" cookie has Keys that contains information about a user:\n<%\nResponse.Cookies(\"user\")(\"firstname\")=\"John\"\nResponse.Cookies(\"user\")(\"lastname\")=\"Smith\"\nResponse.Cookies(\"user\")(\"country\")=\"Norway\"\nResponse.Cookies(\"user\")(\"age\")=\"25\"\n%>\nRead all Cookies\nLook at the following code:\n<%\nResponse.Cookies(\"firstname\")=\"Alex\"\nResponse.Cookies(\"user\")(\"firstname\")=\"John\"\nResponse.Cookies(\"user\")(\"lastname\")=\"Smith\"\nResponse.Cookies(\"user\")(\"country\")=\"Norway\"\nResponse.Cookies(\"user\")(\"age\")=\"25\"\n%>\nAssume that your server has sent all the cookies above to a user.\nNow we want to read all the cookies sent to a user. The example below shows \nhow to do it (note that the code below checks if a cookie has Keys with the HasKeys property):\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<body>\n<%\ndim x,y\nfor each x in Request.Cookies\nresponse.write(\"<p>\")\nif Request.Cookies(x).HasKeys then\nfor each y in Request.Cookies(x)\nresponse.write(x & \":\" & y & \"=\"\u00a0& Request.Cookies(x)(y))\nresponse.write(\"<br>\")\n\nelse\nResponse.Write(x & \"=\" & Request.Cookies(x) & \"<br>\")\nend if\nresponse.write \"</p>\"\n\n%>\n</body>\n</html>\nOutput:\nfirstname=Alex\nuser:firstname=John\nuser:lastname=Smith\nuser:country=Norway\nuser:age=25\nWhat if a Browser Does NOT Support Cookies?\nIf your application deals with browsers that do not support cookies, you will\nhave to use other methods to pass information from one page to another in your application.\nThere are two ways of doing this:\n1. Add parameters to a URL\nYou can add parameters to a URL:\n<a href=\"welcome.asp?fname=John&lname=Smith\">Go to Welcome Page</a>\nAnd retrieve the values in the \"welcome.asp\" file like this:\n<%\nfname=Request.querystring(\"fname\")\nlname=Request.querystring(\"lname\")\nresponse.write(\"<p>Hello \" & fname & \" \" & lname & \"!</p>\")\nresponse.write(\"<p>Welcome to my Web site!</p>\")\n%>\n2. Use a form\nYou can use a form. The form passes the user input to \"welcome.asp\" when the user clicks on the Submit button:\n<form method=\"post\" action=\"welcome.asp\">\nFirst Name:  <input type=\"text\" name=\"fname\" value=\"\">\nLast Name: <input type=\"text\" name=\"lname\" value=\"\">\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n</form>\nRetrieve the values in the \"welcome.asp\" file like this:\n<%\nfname=Request.form(\"fname\")\nlname=Request.form(\"lname\")\nresponse.write(\"<p>Hello \" & fname & \" \" & lname & \"!</p>\")\nresponse.write(\"<p>Welcome to my Web site!</p>\")\n%>\n\n\u2605\n+1",
