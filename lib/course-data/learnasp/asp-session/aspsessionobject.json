This is much like a Session. The computer knows who you are. It\nknows when you open the application and when you close it. However, on the internet there is one\nproblem: the web server does not know who you are and what you do, because the HTTP address doesn't maintain state.\nASP solves this problem by creating a unique cookie for each user. The cookie\nis sent to the user's computer and it contains information that identifies the user. This\ninterface is called the Session object.\nThe Session object stores information about, or change settings for a user session.\nVariables stored in a Session object hold information about one single user, and are available to all pages in one application. Common information\nstored in session variables are name, id, and preferences. The server creates a new Session object for each new user, and destroys the Session object when the session expires.\nThe Session object's collections, properties, methods, and events are \ndescribed below:\nCollections\nCollection\nDescription\nContents\nContains all the items appended to the session through a script command\nStaticObjects\nContains all the objects appended to the session with the HTML\n      <object> tag\nProperties\nProperty\nDescription\nCodePage\nSpecifies the character set that will be used when \n    displaying dynamic content\nLCID\nSets or returns an integer that specifies a location or\n      region. Contents like date, time, and currency will be displayed according\n      to that location or region\nSessionID\nReturns a unique id for each user. The unique id is\n      generated by the server\nTimeout\nSets or returns the timeout period (in minutes) for the\n      Session object in this application\nMethods\nMethod\nDescription\nAbandon\nDestroys a user session\nContents.Remove\nDeletes an item from the Contents collection\nContents.RemoveAll()\nDeletes all items from the Contents collection\nEvents\nEvent\nDescription\nSession_OnEnd\nOccurs when a session ends\nSession_OnStart\nOccurs when a session starts\n\n\u2605\n+1",
