Copy Your Data\nIf your application contains data or a database. For instance an SQL Server Compact database (a .sdf file in App_Data \nfolder), consider the following:\nDo you want to publish your test data to the \nremote server?\nMost likely not.\nIf you have test data on your development computer, it may overwrite production data on your remote hosting computer.\nIf you have to copy an SQL database (.sdf file), perhaps you should delete \neverything in the database, and then copy the empty .sdf file from your development \ncomputer to the server.\nTHAT'S IT. GOOD LUCK !\n\n\u2605\n+1",
