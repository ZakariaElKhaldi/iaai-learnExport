The difference\nis that ALL users share ONE Application object (with Sessions there is ONE Session object for EACH user).\nThe Application object holds information that will be used by many pages in the application (like database connection information).\nThe information can be accessed from any page. The information can also be changed in one place, and the changes will automatically be reflected\non all pages.\nThe Application object's collections, methods, and events are described \nbelow:\nCollections\nCollection\nDescription\nContents\nContains all the items appended to the application\n      through a script command\nStaticObjects\nContains all the objects appended to the application with the HTML <object> tag\nMethods\nMethod\nDescription\nContents.Remove\nDeletes an item from the Contents collection\nContents.RemoveAll()\nDeletes all items from the Contents collection\nLock\nPrevents other users from modifying the variables in the\n      Application object\nUnlock\nEnables other users to modify the variables in the Application object\n      (after it has been locked using the Lock method)\nEvents\nEvent\nDescription\nApplication_OnEnd\nOccurs when all user sessions are over, and the application ends\nApplication_OnStart\nOccurs before the first new session is created (when the Application object is first referenced)\n\n\u2605\n+1",
