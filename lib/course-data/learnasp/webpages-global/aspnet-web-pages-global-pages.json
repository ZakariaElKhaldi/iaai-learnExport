For example, if a \nweb page contains an input form, the web page typically contains server code for \nreading the data.\nHowever, by creating a page named _AppStart in the root of your site, you can \nhave startup code executed before the site starts. If this page \nexists, ASP.NET runs it the first time any page in the site is requested.\nTypical use for _AppStart is startup code and initialization of global values \nlike counters and global names.\nNote 1:\n_AppStart should have the same file extension as your \nweb pages, like: _AppStart.cshtml.\nNote 2:\n_AppStart has an underscore prefix. Because of this, \nthe files cannot be browsed directly.\nBefore Every Page: _PageStart\nJust like _AppStart runs before your site starts, you can write code that \nruns before any page in each folder.\nFor each folder in your web, you can add a file named _PageStart.\nTypical use for _PageStart is setting the layout page for all pages in a \nfolder, or checking that a user is logged in before running a page.\nHow Does it Work?\nThe following diagram shows how it works:\nWhen a request comes in, ASP.NET checks whether _AppStart exists. \nIf so, and this is the first request to the site, _AppStart runs.\nThen ASP.NET checks whether _PageStart exists. If so, _PageStart runs, before the requested page.\nIf you include a call to RunPage() inside _PageStart you specify where you want \nthe requested page to run. If not, the _PageStart runs before the \nrequested page.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
