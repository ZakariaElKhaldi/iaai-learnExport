Here are some examples of Cyber Crime:\nIdentity Theft\nOnline Predators\nBEC (\"Business Email Compromise\")\nRansomware\nStealing of sensitive intellectual property\nIncreasing Crime\nCyber Crime has been increasing regularly every year. Why is Cyber Crime on the rise? Here are some reasons:\nCyber Crime is easy to accomplish\nLow risks of getting caught\nFor little work there is often high returns\nAttackers can target thousands of victims\nMoney laundering is easier with Cryptocurrencies\nChallenges like identity theft can have significant consequences on an individual, causing not only the potential of financial losses but also a lot of personal grief.\nThe Internet offers many services to facilitate money laundering, usually making it a trivial process. As money is exchanged in cryptocurrency, services such as tumblers make it hard to track the money.\nTumblers are services which split up cryptocurrency transactions and forward the money through many accounts, with different values, for thousands of people, making them hard to track.\nCyber Criminals\nWho are Cyber Criminals? It can be anyone, but let us discuss some common ones we see in the media all the time:\nState-sponsored groups targeting organizations in other countries\nHacking Groups out to target companies to make them pay ransom\nKids in their rooms doing illegal hacking\nNote:\nCryptocurrency is money represented in digital form instead of physical. There are many different \n      Cryptocurrencies, some very widespread like Bitcoin, and others smaller and unknown to most people. These currency models relies on strong cryptography and public ledger systems to keep track of transactions and how much currency is on the market.\nCatching Cyber Criminals\nCyber Criminals can stay anonymous with trivial means, and typically easy to avoid getting caught. When attackers do get caught, it is often because of mistakes made by the attackers themselves, for example as a result of becoming complacent. There is also a great deal of potential for law-enforcement to use caught cyber criminals to rat out others in the industry.\nLaw enforcement do, however, have many challenges in tracking down cyber-crime. You might see attack traffic coming in from a system residing in UK, and when taking down this system, you realize it was being remotely controlled by \ne.g. another system in India. Cooperating with law-enforcements across borders, you might be able to get to the system in India, but only to realize it was again remotely controlled through \ne.g. Pakistan.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
