      "content": "Protocols and Networking\nIt is essential for Cyber Security Professionals to have a solid understanding of how computers communicate. There is much more happening behind the scenes of computer networks than what can be observed when using applications.\nThe OSI Model\nThe OSI (\"Open Systems Interconnection\") model represents an easy and intuitive way to standardize the different parts required to communicate \nacross networks.\nThe model makes it clear what is required to communicate on a network by splitting the requirements into multiple layers.\nThis is what the OSI Model looks like:\nLayer\nWhat it does\n7 - Application\nWhere humans process data and information\n6 - Presentation\nEnsures data is in a usable format\n5 - Session\nCapable of maintaining connections\n4 - Transport\nData is forwarded to a service capable of handling requests\n3 - Network Layer\nResponsible for which path packets should travel on a network\n2 - Data Link\nResponsible for which physical devices packets should go to\n1 - Physical\nThe physical infrastructure to transport data\nThe top 3 layers are typically implemented in software within the Operating System:\nLayer\nWhere it is implemented\n7 - Application\nSoftware\n6 - Presentation\nSoftware\n5 - Session\nSoftware\nThe bottom 3 layers are typically implemented in hardware within devices on the network, e.g. Switches, Routers and Firewalls:\nLayer\nWhere it is implemented\n3 - Network Layer\nHardware\n2 - Data Link\nHardware\n1 - Physical\nHardware\nLayer 4, the Transport layer, connects the software with the hardware layers.\nSDN (\"Software Defined Networking\") is technology which allows more layers of the hardware to be implemented via software.\nLayer 7 - Application Layer\nThe business logic and functionality of the application lies here. This is what the users use to interact with services across a network. Most developers create applications on the Application Layer.\nMost of the applications you use are on the Application Layer, with the complexity of the other layers hidden.\nExamples of Layer 7 Applications:\nHTTP (\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol\") - Enables us to access web applications\nFTP (\"File Transfer Protocol\") - Allows users to transfer files\nSNMP (\"Simple Network Management Protocol\") - Protocol to read and update network device configurations\nThere are many applications which uses these protocols like Google Chrome, Microsoft Skype and FileZilla.\nYou are accessing this class via Layer 7!\nLayer 6 - Presentation Layer\nTypically an unseen layer, but is responsible of adapting, transforming and translating data. This is to ensure the application and layers beneath \ncan understand one another.\nEncoding Schemes used to represent text and data, for example ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and UTF(Unicode Transformation Format).\nEncryption for services, for example SSL (\"Secure Sockets Layer\") and TLS (\"Transport Security Layer\")\nCompression, for example GZip in use in many implementations of HTTP.\nLayer 5 - Session Layer\nThis layer's responsibility is handling connections between the application and the layers below. It involves establishing, maintaining and terminating connections, otherwise referred to as sessions.\nCommon protocols which represent the Session Layer well are:\nSOCKS - A protocol for sending packets through a proxy server.\nNetBIOS - An older Windows protocol for establishing sessions and resolving names.\nSIP (\"Session Initiation Protocol\") - For engaging in VOIP (\"Voice Over IP\") communications\nLayer 4 - Transport\nThe layer which allows applications to be represented on the network.\nSome well known applications on this layer:\nTCP (\"Transmission Control Protocol\") - Used for many applications, ensuring stability, control of how much data can be sent at any given time, reliability and more.\nUDP (\"User Datagram Protocol\") - Lightweight and quick protocol use for many services.\nQUIC (\"Quick UDP Internet Connections\") - A protocol designed for faster connections and goes hand-in-hand with the version 2 of the HTTP protocol.\nLayer 3 - Network\nA layer responsible of routing packets between networks via routers.\nOn this layer, the following protocols reside:\nIP (\"Internet Protocol\") - Used everyday when accessing the Internet. Comes in two versions, IP version 4 and 6.\nICMP (\"Internet Control Message Protocol\") - Used by network devices and network operators, to diagnose network connections or for devices to send and respond to error conditions and more.\nIPSec (\"Internet Protocol Security\") - Allows encrypted and secure connections between two network devices.\nLayer 2 - Link\nLink networks, as the name implies, consist of protocols designed to send \npackets through the actual links (physical connections) that network nodes are \nconnected to. A simpler way of thinking of it is that the Link Layer is \nresponsible for moving data from physical over to logical (to the network \nlayer).\nProtocols on this layer include:\nEthernet - An essential protocol used by most operating systems when connecting to networks using a physical cable.\nWi-Fi (\"Wireless Fidelity\") - For accessing networks via radio signals. It uses a family of protocols called IEEE 802.11.xx\nNDP (\"Neighbor Discovery Protocol\") - IP version 6(IPv6) uses this protocol on the Link Layer to gather information required to communicate via IPv6\nLayer 1 - Physical\nPhysical layer represents the signaling which allows bits and bytes to transfer between a physical medium. It can be transferred via radio or signals over a cable, using electrical signals or light, for example fiber.\nExamples of the Physical Layer protocols includes:\nCAN Bus (\"Controller Area Network\") - Used in microcontrollers and other devices to communicate to other similar devices, not involving a computer. Often used in ICS (\"Industrial Control Systems\").\nEthernet Physical Layer - Used by Ethernet on the physical layer to send signals with speeds up to many gigabits of traffic per second.\nBluetooth Physical Layer - Bluetooth also has its own specifications on how radio signals should be sent and received.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
