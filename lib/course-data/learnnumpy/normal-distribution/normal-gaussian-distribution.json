IQ Scores, Heartbeat etc.\nUse the\nrandom.normal()\nmethod to get a Normal Data Distribution.\nIt has three parameters:\nloc\n- (Mean) where the peak of the bell exists.\nscale\n- (Standard Deviation) how flat the graph distribution should be.\nsize\n- The shape of the returned array.\nExample\nGenerate a random normal distribution of size 2x3:\nfrom numpy import random\nx = random.normal(size=(2, 3))\nprint(x)\n\nExample\nGenerate a random normal distribution of size 2x3 with mean at 1 and standard deviation of 2:\nfrom numpy import random\nx = random.normal(loc=1, scale=2, size=(2, 3))\nprint(x)\n\nVisualization of Normal Distribution\nExample\nfrom numpy import random\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.displot(random.normal(size=1000), kind=\"kde\")\nplt.show()\nResult\n\nNote:\nThe curve of a Normal Distribution is also known as the Bell Curve because of the bell-shaped curve.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
