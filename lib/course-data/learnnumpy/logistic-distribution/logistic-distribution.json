      "content": "Logistic Distribution\nLogistic Distribution is used to describe growth.\nUsed extensively in machine learning in logistic regression, neural networks etc.\nIt has three parameters:\nloc\n- mean, where the peak is. Default 0.\nscale\n- standard deviation, the flatness of distribution. Default 1.\nsize\n- The shape of the returned array.\nExample\nDraw 2x3 samples from a logistic distribution with mean at 1 and stddev 2.0:\nfrom numpy import random\nx = random.logistic(loc=1, scale=2, size=(2, \n  3))\nprint(x)\n\nVisualization of Logistic Distribution\nExample\nfrom numpy import random\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.displot(random.logistic(size=1000), kind=\"kde\")\nplt.show()\nResult\n\nDifference Between Logistic and Normal Distribution\nBoth distributions are near identical, but logistic distribution has more area under the tails, \nmeaning it represents more possibility of occurrence of an event further away from mean.\nFor higher value of scale (standard deviation) the normal and logistic distributions are near identical apart from the peak.\nExample\nfrom numpy import random\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\ndata = {\n\"normal\": random.normal(scale=2, size=1000),\n\"logistic\": random.logistic(size=1000)\n}\nsns.displot(data, kind=\"kde\")\nplt.show()\nResult\n\n\u2605\n+1",
