It is an open source project \nand you can use it freely.\nNumPy stands for Numerical Python.\nWhy Use NumPy?\nIn Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.\nNumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than \ntraditional Python lists.\nThe array object in NumPy is called\nndarray\n, \nit provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with\nndarray\nvery easy.\nArrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources \nare very important.\nData Science:\nis a branch of computer science where we study how to store, use and analyze data for deriving information from it.\nWhy is NumPy Faster Than Lists?\nNumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.\nThis behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.\nThis is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.\nWhich Language is NumPy written in?\nNumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.\nWhere is the NumPy Codebase?\nThe source code for NumPy is located at this github repository\n\ngithub:\nenables many people to work on the same \n  codebase.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
