It is required to make the \n  changes, otherwise no \n  changes are made to the table.\nNotice the WHERE clause in the DELETE syntax:\nThe WHERE clause \nspecifies which record(s) that should be deleted. If you omit the WHERE \nclause, all records will be deleted!\nPrevent SQL Injection\nIt is considered a good practice to escape the values of any query, also in delete statements.\nThis is to prevent SQL injections, which is a common web hacking technique to  \ndestroy or misuse your database.\nThe mysql.connector module uses the placeholder\n%s\nto escape values in the delete statement:\nExample\nEscape values by using the placeholder\n%s\nmethod:\nimport mysql.connector\nmydb = mysql.connector.connect(\nhost=\"localhost\",\nuser=\"\nyourusername\n\",\npassword=\"\nyourpassword\n\",\ndatabase=\"mydatabase\"\n)\nmycursor = mydb.cursor()\nsql = \"DELETE FROM customers WHERE address = \n  %s\"\nadr = (\"Yellow Garden 2\", )\nmycursor.execute(sql, adr)\nmydb.commit()\nprint(mycursor.rowcount, \"record(s) deleted\")\nRun example \u00bb\n\n\u2605\n+1",
