They will \n  both give you the same result.\nLEFT JOIN\nIn the example above, Hannah, and Michael were excluded from the result, that \nis because INNER JOIN only shows the records where there is a match.\nIf you want to show all users, even if they do not have a favorite product, \nuse the LEFT JOIN statement:\nExample\nSelect all users and their favorite product:\nsql = \"SELECT \\\nusers.name AS user, \n  \\\nproducts.name AS favorite \\\nFROM users \\\nLEFT JOIN \n  products ON users.fav = products.id\"\nRun example \u00bb\nRIGHT JOIN\nIf you want to return all products, and the users who have them as their \nfavorite, even if no user have them as their favorite, use the RIGHT JOIN \nstatement:\nExample\nSelect all products, and the user(s) who have them as their favorite:\nsql = \"SELECT \\\nusers.name AS user, \n  \\\nproducts.name AS favorite \\\nFROM users \\\nRIGHT JOIN \n  products ON users.fav = products.id\"\nRun example \u00bb\nNote:\nHannah and Michael, who have no favorite product, are not included in the result.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
