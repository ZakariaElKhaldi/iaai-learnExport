The study plans can be customized to ensure that everyone is challenged.\nSave time with pre-built teacher materials and study plans. Easily organize your class with a timeline from the introduction of Python to the final exam.\n Academy\nThe study plan is a feature of  Academy.\n Academy is a platform that has everything you need to teach coding, all in one place.\nIt offers you as a teacher a toolbox of features that helps you succeed with teaching in your classroom.\nYou need to have an active subscription to access the study plan feature. There are two different subscription tiers:\nEssentials ($1.99 / month per student)\nFull Access ($5.99 / month per student)\nCalculate your price and order\nhere\n.\nLearn More \u00bb\nAcademy also offer other features such as:\nManaging your classroom\nTracking of student progress and reports\nLabs, assignments, and code challenges (prebuilt challenges or create your own ones)\nAuto-grading\nTeaching materials\nCertification exams\nGet a free demo \u00bb\nTeacher Materials\n has everything you need to teach Python.\nThe Python training materials is available for you to include and use in your study plan:\n Python Tutorial\nPython Exercises\nPython Quiz\nPython Challenges (Coding challenges)\nPython Certification Exam (End of Pathway Exam)\nPython Syllabus\nWith the Python Syllabus, your students will start with the basics, like understanding variables and data types, and move to more advanced topics, like working with loops, functions, and file handling. Each chapter has examples, try-it-yourself sections, exercises, and quizzes to make learning easy, interactive, and fun.\nRead more about Python Syllabus\n.\nStudy Plan Overview\nThe study plan features are made to help teachers and students. They make learning easy, flexible, and fun. These features work for different types of classes, learning styles and student level.\nLearning Paths\nYou can add ready-made learning paths.\nThe learning paths are by default ordered by our recommended order.\nYou can change the order.\nYou can add custom activities with text, links, or multi-media files.\nDrag and drop or click to make changes to the path.\nInteractive Content\nTutorials\nTry-its (test code snippets)\nExercises\nQuiz\nChallenges\nLabs\nTimeline and Pace\nYou can set a timeline of your study plan (e.g., 4-week, 8-week, 12-week, 24-week plans).\nYou can decide the learning pace for your class.\nDifferent study plans can be assigned to different students in the same class.\nThe flexibility can help to make sure that everyone is challenged.\nTrack Student Progress\nThere are tools to track student progress.\nThe analytic tools include: chapter progress, exercises results, quiz results, exam results, and much more.\nThe challenges can be auto-graded or manually graded. The results are available to you as a teacher.\nEnd of Pathway Exam\nThe Python study plan aligns with the Python Certification Exam.\nThe exam can be taken at the end of the study plan, at your selected date.\nThe exam summarizes the Python Tutorial.\nYou get reports of the students' results.\nAccessibility\nStudy plans and learning materials are accessible on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.\nThis ensures students can learn anytime, anywhere.\nLearn More \u00bb\nSample Study Plan\nYou choose the timeline and pace\nof your study plans.\nSchools have different preferences.\nSome would like more intensive pace, e.g. 5 weeks, others 12 or more weeks.\nIt is completely up to you.\nFor example, this is how a 5-week Python study plan could look like:\nWeek 1: Introduction, variables, Data Types, Numbers & Casting\nWeek 2: Strings, Booleans & Operators, Lists, Tuples\nWeek 3: Sets, Dictionaries\nWeek 4: Conditionals, Loops & Iterators, Polymorphism, Arrays, Objects, Inheritance & Scope, Functions & Lambdas\nWeek 5: Miscellaneous, File Handling, MySQL, MongoDB, Matplotlib, Machine Learning, Python Certification Exam\nImage of Sample Python study plan:\nReady to get started?\nStart with\nPython Study Plans\ntoday.\nGet Started \u00bb\nAre You a Teacher?\nAre you interested in learning how you can use\n Academy\nto Teach Python programming?\nWatch a demo of\n Academy\n. You'll see how it works, and discover how it can make teaching programming easier and more engaging.\nWatch Demo \u00bb\n\n\u2605\n+1",
