      "content": "Plotting x and y points\nThe\nplot()\nfunction is used to draw points (markers) in a diagram.\nBy default, the\nplot()\nfunction draws a line from point to point.\nThe function takes parameters for specifying points in the diagram.\nParameter 1 is an array containing the points on the\nx-axis\n.\nParameter 2 is an array containing the points on the\ny-axis\n.\nIf we need to plot a line from (1, 3) to (8, 10), we have to pass two arrays [1, 8] and [3, 10] to the plot function.\nExample\nDraw a line in a diagram from position (1, 3) to position (8, 10):\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nxpoints = np.array([1, 8])\nypoints = np.array([3, 10])\nplt.plot(xpoints, ypoints)\nplt.show()\nResult:\n\nThe\nx-axis\nis the horizontal axis.\nThe\ny-axis\nis the vertical axis.\nPlotting Without Line\nTo plot only the markers, you can use\nshortcut string notation\nparameter 'o', which means 'rings'.\nExample\nDraw two points in the diagram, one at position (1, 3) and one in position (8, 10):\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nxpoints = np.array([1, 8])\nypoints = np.array([3, 10])\nplt.plot(xpoints, ypoints, 'o')\nplt.show()\nResult:\n\nYou will learn more about markers in the \nMultiple Points\nYou can plot as many points as you like, just make sure you have the same number of points in both axis.\nExample\nDraw a line in a diagram from position (1, 3) to (2, 8) then to (6, 1) and finally to position (8, 10):\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nxpoints = np.array([1, 2, 6, 8])\nypoints = np.array([3, 8, 1, 10])\nplt.plot(xpoints, ypoints)\nplt.show()\nResult:\n\nDefault X-Points\nIf we do not specify the points on the x-axis, they will get the default values 0, 1, 2, 3 etc., depending on the length of the y-points.\nSo, if we take the same example as above, and leave out the x-points, the diagram will look like this:\nExample\nPlotting without x-points:\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nypoints = np.array([3, 8, 1, 10, 5, 7])\nplt.plot(ypoints)\nplt.show()\nResult:\n\nThe\nx-points\nin the example above are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n\n\u2605\n+1",
