Each chapter includes simple examples, try-it-yourself sections, exercises, and quizzes to make learning easy, interactive, and fun.\nRead more about PostgreSQL Syllabus\n.\nStudy Plan Overview\nThe study plan features are made to help teachers and students. They make learning easy, flexible, and fun. These features work for different types of classes, learning styles and student level.\nLearning Paths\nYou can add ready-made learning paths.\nThe learning paths are by default ordered by our recommended order.\nYou can change the order.\nYou can add custom activities with text, links, or multi-media files.\nDrag and drop or click to make changes to the path.\nInteractive Content\nTutorials\nTry-its (test code snippets)\nExercises\nQuiz\nChallenges\nLabs\nTimeline and Pace\nYou can set a timeline of your study plan (e.g., 4-week, 8-week, 12-week, 24-week plans).\nYou can decide the learning pace for your class.\nDifferent study plans can be assigned to different students in the same class.\nThe flexibility can help to make sure that everyone is challenged.\nTrack Student Progress\nThere are tools to track student progress.\nThe analytic tools include: chapter progress, exercises results, quiz results, exam results, and much more.\nThe challenges can be auto-graded or manually graded. The results are available to you as a teacher.\nEnd of Pathway Exam\nThe PostgreSQL study plan aligns with the PostgreSQL Certification Exam.\nThe exam can be taken at the end of the study plan, at your selected date.\nThe exam summarizes the PostgreSQL Tutorial.\nYou get reports of the students' results.\nAccessibility\nStudy plans and learning materials are accessible on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.\nThis ensures students can learn anytime, anywhere.\nLearn More \u00bb\nSample Study Plan\nYou choose the timeline and pace\nof your study plans.\nSchools have different preferences.\nSome would like more intensive pace, e.g. 3 weeks, others 12 or more weeks.\nIt is completely up to you.\nFor example, this is how a 3-week PostgreSQL study plan could look like:\nWeek 1: Basic Database Management\nWeek 2: Database operations\nWeek 3: Querying data, PostgreSQL Certification Exam\nImage of Sample PostgreSQL study plan:\nReady to get started?\nStart with\nPostgreSQL Study Plans\ntoday.\nGet Started \u00bb\nAre You a Teacher?\nAre you interested in learning how you can use\n Academy\nto Teach PostgreSQL programming?\nWatch a demo of\n Academy\n. You'll see how it works, and discover how it can make teaching programming easier and more engaging.\nWatch Demo \u00bb\n\n\u2605\n+1",
