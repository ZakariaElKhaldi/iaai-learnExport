To add a space when concatenating, use\n|| ' ' ||\n.\nExample\nConcatenate, with space:\nSELECT product_name || ' ' || unit AS product\nFROM products;\nRun Example \u00bb\nUsing Aliases With a Space Character\nIf you want your alias to contain one or more spaces, like \"\nMy Great Products\n\", surround your alias with double quotes.\nExample\nSurround your alias with double quotes:\nSELECT product_name AS \"My Great Products\"\nFROM products;\nRun Example \u00bb\n\n\u2605\n+1",
