It is updated and improved frequently.\nThe syllabus outline and its sequence are structured so you can learn PostgreSQL step by step, from the introduction to advanced database management.\nGet Started With PostgreSQL \u00bb\nLearning Outcomes\nUnderstand the basic concepts of PostgreSQL databases.\nCreate and manage PostgreSQL databases and tables.\nWrite and optimize SQL queries for PostgreSQL.\nWork with PostgreSQL data types and functions.\nImplement database constraints and relationships.\nHandle database administration tasks.\nNote:\nAre you a teacher teaching PostgreSQL?\n Academy\nis a toolbox of features that can help you teach. It offers classroom features such as pre-built study plans, classroom administration and much more. Read more about\nAcademy here\n.\nWhich Subjects Are PostgreSQL Relevant For?\nDatabase Management:\nPostgreSQL can be usedfor managing relational databases.\nWeb Development:\nPostgreSQL is widely used in web applications.\nData Analysis:\nPostgreSQL supports data analysis tasks.\nEnterprise Applications:\nPostgreSQL is suitable for large-scale enterprise systems.\nGIS Applications:\nPostgreSQL has strong support for geographic data.\nData Warehousing:\nPostgreSQL handles large data warehouses efficiently.\nApplication Development:\nPostgreSQL integrates well with various programming languages.\nGet Started\nActivities\nIn this tutorial we offer different activities for you to learn PostgreSQL for free:\nLessons\nExercises\nQuizzes\nSign in to Track Progress\nYou can also create a free account to \nAs a signed-in user, you get access to features such as:\nLearning paths\nSandbox and lab environments\nAchievements\nAnd much more!\n\nOverview of the Modules\nPostgreSQL Home\nPostgreSQL Intro\nPostgreSQL Install\nPostgreSQL Get Started\nPostgreSQL pgAdmin 4\nPostgreSQL CREATE TABLE\nPostgreSQL INSERT INTO\nPostgreSQL Fetch Data\nPostgreSQL ADD COLUMN\nPostgreSQL UPDATE\nPostgreSQL ALTER COLUMN\nPostgreSQL DROP COLUMN\nPostgreSQL DELETE\nPostgreSQL DROP TABLE\nCreate Demo Database\nPostgreSQL Operators\nPostgreSQL SELECT\nPostgreSQL SELECT DISTINCT\nPostgreSQL WHERE\nPostgreSQL ORDER BY\nPostgreSQL LIMIT\nPostgreSQL MIN and MAX\nPostgreSQL COUNT\nPostgreSQL SUM\nPostgreSQL AVG\nPostgreSQL LIKE\nPostgreSQL IN\nPostgreSQL BETWEEN\nPostgreSQL AS\nPostgreSQL Joins\nPostgreSQL INNER JOIN\nPostgreSQL LEFT JOIN\nPostgreSQL RIGHT JOIN\nPostgreSQL FULL JOIN\nPostgreSQL CROSS JOIN\nPostgreSQL UNION\nPostgreSQL GROUP BY\nPostgreSQL HAVING\nPostgreSQL EXISTS\nPostgreSQL ANY\nPostgreSQL ALL\nPostgreSQL CASE\nGet Started\nSandbox and Lab Environment\nPostgreSQL, like any database system, is best learned through hands-on practice.\nTry this example using our editor:\nExample\nSort the table by year:\nSELECT * FROM cars\nORDER BY year;\nRun Example \u00bb\nIf you want to explore more and host your project, we have a feature called\nSpaces\nthat allows you to build, test and run websites.\nHere you get a secure sandbox environment called Spaces, where you can practice coding and test projects in real-time.\nThis includes a  subdomain, hosting, and secure SSL certificates.\nPostgreSQL is not hosted on  Spaces; you need to set it up on a platform like Supabase or Heroku and connect your application to it.\nSpaces require no installation and run directly in the browser.\nFeatures include:\nCollaboration\nFile navigator\nTerminal & log\nPackage manager\nDatabase\nEnvironment manager\nAnalytics\nCreate a Spaces Account\nPostgreSQL Certification\n offers an end-of-pathway certification program.\nHere you can take exams to get certified.\nThe PostgreSQL exam is a test that summarizes the  PostgreSQL syllabus.\nAfter passing the exam you get the \"Certified PostgreSQL Developer\" Certification.\nThe certification exam is adaptive and graded; students will get a grade from intermediate, advanced to professional.\nBuy Certificate \u00bb\nAre You a Teacher?\nAre you interested in learning how you can use\n Academy\nto Teach \nPostgreSQL?\nWatch a demo of\n Academy\n.
