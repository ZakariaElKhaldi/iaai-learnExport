When you make changes during development and save them, Vite will update the page instantly. This requires a lot of resources from the computer.\nThe build step comes after the development phase, when the page is ready to go public. We then have to build our project into files the browser understands without running Vite in development mode. The build step is done to minimize server resource usage and improve performance.\nTo build your Vue application, stop the development server if it is running, by pressing 'Q' or 'ctrl'+'C', then write:\nnpm run build\nWhen your project is built, Vite creates a folder\ndist\nwith all the files needed to run your project on a public server, with files the browser understands\n*.html\n,\n*.css\nand\n*.js\ninstead of the\n*.vue\nfiles we use during development.\nTo see your built project in the browser, use the commando:\nnpm run preview\nThis commando should open a browser window that displays the built project from the\ndist\nfolder.\nVue Exercises\nTest Yourself With Exercises\nExercise:\nThe\ncommand compiles our Vue project \ninto .html, .js and .css files that are \noptimized to run directly in the\n.\nSubmit Answer \u00bb\nStart the Exercise\n\n\u2605\n+1",
