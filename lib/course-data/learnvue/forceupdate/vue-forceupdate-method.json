The\n$forceUpdate()\nmethod does not accept any arguments.\nNote:\nIn normal cases, an element will be automatically included in Vue's reactivity system, and the Vue application will therefore re-render automatically when the element changes. But, in advanced cases when an element is marked explicitly as not part of the Vue reactivity system, the\n$forceUpdate()\nmethod can be used.\nRelated Pages\nVue Reference:\nVue $\nVue Reference:\nVue $refs Object\nVue Reference:\nVue 'key' Attribute\n\nVue Component Instance Reference\n\n\u2605\n+1",
