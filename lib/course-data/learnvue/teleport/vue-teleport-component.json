So in case more than one element is teleported to the same destination, the last element teleported will end up below other teleported elements.\nIf\n<Teleport>\nis used to move a component, the communication to and from that component with provide/inject or prop/emit still works like before, as if the component was not moved.\nAlso, if some content is moved out of a component with\n<Teleport>\n, Vue makes sure that relevant code inside the component in the\n<script>\nand\n<style>\ntags still works for the moved content. See the example below.\nProps\nProp\nDescription\nto\nRequired. String. Specify the name of the target\nRun Example \u00bb\ndisabled\nOptional. Boolean. Specify if the teleport functionality should be disabled\nRun Example \u00bb\nMore Examples\nExample\nRelevant code from the\n<style>\nand\n<script>\ntags still works for the teleported\n<div>\ntag even though it is no longer inside the component after compilation.\nCompOne.vue\n:\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <h2>Component</h2>\n    <p>This is the inside of the component.</p>\n    <Teleport to=\"body\">\n      <div \n        id=\"redDiv\" \n        @click=\"toggleVal = !toggleVal\" \n        :style=\"{ backgroundColor: bgColor }\"\n      >\n        Hello!<br>\n        Click me!\n      </div>\n    </Teleport>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      toggleVal: true\n    }\n  },\n  computed: {\n    bgColor() {\n      if (this.toggleVal) {\n        return 'lightpink'\n      }\n      else {\n        return 'lightgreen'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n#redDiv {\n  margin: 10px;\n  padding: 10px;\n  display: inline-block;\n}\n\n#redDiv:hover {\n  cursor: pointer;\n}\n</style>\nRun Example \u00bb\nExample\nThe boolean\ndisabled\nprop is toggled with a button so that the\n<div>\nelement is either teleported, or not.\nCompOne.vue\n:\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <h2>Component</h2>\n    <p>This is the inside of the component.</p>\n    <button @click=\"teleportOn = !teleportOn\">Teleport on/off</button>\n    <Teleport to=\"body\" :disabled=\"teleportOn\">\n      <div id=\"redDiv\">Hello!</div>\n    </Teleport>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      teleportOn: true\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n  #redDiv {\n    background-color: lightcoral;\n    margin: 10px;\n    padding: 10px;\n    width: 100px;\n  }\n</style>\nRun Example \u00bb\nRelated Pages\nVue Tutorial:\nVue Teleport\n\nVue Built-in Components Reference\n\n\u2605\n+1",
