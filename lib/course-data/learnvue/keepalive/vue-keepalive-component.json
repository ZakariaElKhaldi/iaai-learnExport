Specify the names of the components that should keep their state\nRun Example \u00bb\nexclude\nOptional. Specify the names of the components that should\nnot\nkeep their state\nRun Example \u00bb\nmax\nOptional. Specify the maximum number of components that should keep their state. If you specify to cache a maximum of 4 components, it will be the 4 components that were last visited that are cached\nRun Example \u00bb\nThe Lifecycle of Components Cached with <KeepAlive>\nComponents that are cached with the built-in\n<KeepAlive>\ncomponent will switch between the\nactivated\nand\ndeactivated\nstates when they are set, or not set, as the active dynamic component.\nThe\nactivated()\nand\ndeactivated()\nlifecycle hooks can be used to run code when such a cached component is set, or not set, as the active component.\nMore Examples\nExample\nUsing the\ninclude\nprop to specify which components that will cache the values:\n<KeepAlive include=\"CompOne,CompThree\">\n\u00a0 <component :is=\"activeComp\"></component>\n</KeepAlive>\nRun Example \u00bb\nExample\nUsing the\nexclude\nprop to specify which components that will\nnot\ncache the values:\n<KeepAlive exclude=\"CompOne\">\n\u00a0 <component :is=\"activeComp\"></component>\n</KeepAlive>\nRun Example \u00bb\nExample\nUsing the\nmax\nprop to specify how many of the last visited components that will cache the values:\n<KeepAlive :max=\"2\">\n\u00a0 <component :is=\"activeComp\"></component>\n</KeepAlive>\nRun Example \u00bb\nRelated Pages\nVue Tutorial:\nDynamic Components\nVue Tutorial:\nThe 'activated' and 'deactivated' Lifecycle Hooks\n\nVue Built-in Components Reference\n\n\u2605\n+1",
