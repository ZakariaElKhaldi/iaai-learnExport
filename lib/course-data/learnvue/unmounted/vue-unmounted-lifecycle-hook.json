That is because at first the component is removed from the DOM, then the alert appears, and then at last, when you click \"OK\" in the alert box, the browser renders the page without the component inside the DOM.\nRelated Pages\nVue Tutorial:\nVue Lifecycle Hooks\nVue Tutorial:\nThe 'unmounted' Hook\nVue Reference:\nVue 'beforeUnmount' Lifecycle Hook\n\nVue Lifecycle Hooks Reference\n\n\u2605\n+1",
