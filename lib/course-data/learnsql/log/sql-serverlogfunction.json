The number to return the natural logarithm of. Must be greater than 0\nbase\nOptional. The base the natural logarithm is to be calculated with. Must be greater \n    than 1\nTechnical Details\nWorks in:\nSQL Server (starting with 2008), Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Data \n  Warehouse, Parallel Data Warehouse\nMore Examples\nExample\nReturn the natural logarithm of 2 to a specified base (4):\nSELECT LOG(2, 4);\n\n\u276f\n\u2605\n+1",
