The users cannot see the indexes, they are just used to speed up searches/queries.\nThe following SQL creates an index named \"uidx_pid\" on the \"PersonID\" column in the \"Persons\" table:\nCREATE UNIQUE INDEX uidx_pid\nON Persons (PersonID);\nNote:\nThe syntax for creating indexes varies among different databases. Therefore: Check the syntax for creating indexes in your database.\nNote:\nUpdating a table with indexes takes more time than updating a table without (because the indexes also need an update).\nSo, only create indexes on columns that will be frequently searched against.\n\nReference\n\n\u276f\n\u2605\n+1",
