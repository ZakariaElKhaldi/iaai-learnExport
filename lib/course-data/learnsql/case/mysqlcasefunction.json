So, once a condition is true, it will stop \nreading and return the result.\nIf no conditions are true, it will return the value in the ELSE clause.\nIf there is no ELSE part and no conditions are true, it returns NULL.\nSyntax\nCASE\nWHEN\ncondition1\nTHEN\nresult1\nWHEN\ncondition2\nTHEN\nresult2\nWHEN\nconditionN\nTHEN\nresultN\nELSE\nresult\nEND;\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\ncondition1, condition2, ...conditionN\nRequired. The conditions. These are evaluated in the same order as they \n    are listed\nresult1, result2, ...resultN\nRequired. The value to return once a condition is true\nTechnical Details\nWorks in:\nFrom MySQL 4.0\nMore Examples\nThe following SQL will order the customers by City. However, if City is NULL, then order by Country:\nExample\nSELECT CustomerName, City, Country\nFROM Customers\nORDER BY\n(CASE\nWHEN City IS NULL THEN Country\nELSE City\nEND);\n\n\u276f\n\u2605\n+1",
