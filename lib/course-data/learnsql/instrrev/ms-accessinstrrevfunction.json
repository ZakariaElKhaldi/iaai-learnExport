The string to be searched\nstring2\nRequired. The string to search for\nstart\nOptional. The start position for the search. Position -1 is default \n    (which means that it starts with the last character position)\ncompare\nOptional. The type of string comparison.\nPossible values:\n-1: Use the setting of Option Compare\n0: Binary comparison\n1: Textual comparison\n2: Comparison based on info in your database\nReturn Values\nIf string2 is not found within string1, this function returns 0\nIf string2 is zero-length, this function returns the value  \n  in the start parameter\nIf string1 is zero-length, this function returns 0\nIf string1 is null, this function returns null\nIf start is > than the length of string2, this function returns 0\nTechnical Details\nWorks in:\nFrom Access 2000\n\n\u276f\n\u2605\n+1",
