The\nGROUP BY\nclause splits the result-set into groups of values and \nthe aggregate function can be used to return a single value for each group.\nThe most commonly used SQL aggregate functions are:\nMIN()\n- returns the smallest value \n  within the selected column\nMAX()\n- returns the largest value within the \n  selected column\nCOUNT()\n- returns the number of rows in a \n  set\nSUM()\n- returns the total sum of a \n  numerical column\nAVG()\n- returns the average value of a \n  numerical column\nAggregate functions ignore null values (except for\nCOUNT()\n).\nWe will go through the aggregate functions above in the\n\n\u2605\n+1",
