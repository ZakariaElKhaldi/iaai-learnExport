Notice that it requires \ndouble quotation marks or square brackets if the alias name contains spaces:\nExample\nSELECT CustomerName AS Customer, ContactName AS [Contact Person]\nFROM Customers;\n\nThe following SQL statement creates an alias named \"Address\" that combine four columns (Address, PostalCode, \nCity and Country):\nExample\nSELECT CustomerName, Address + ', ' + PostalCode + ' ' + City + ', ' + Country \n  AS Address\nFROM Customers;\n\nNote:\nTo get the SQL statement above to work in MySQL use the following:\nSELECT CustomerName, CONCAT(Address,', ',PostalCode,', ',City,', ',Country) AS Address\nFROM Customers;\nAlias for Tables\nThe following SQL statement selects all the orders from the customer with \nCustomerID=4 (Around the Horn). We use the \"Customers\" and \"Orders\" tables, and \ngive them the table aliases of \"c\" and \"o\" respectively (Here we use \naliases to make the SQL shorter):\nExample\nSELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName\nFROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o\nWHERE c.CustomerName=\"Around the Horn\" AND c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID;\n\nReference\n\n\u276f\n\u2605\n+1",
