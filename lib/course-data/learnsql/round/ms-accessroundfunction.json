Here are some examples:\nRound(34.55, 1) - Result: 34.6 (rounds up)\nRound(34.65, 1) -\nResult: 34.6 (rounds down)\nSyntax\nRound(\nexpression\n,\ndecimal_places\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\nexpression\nRequired. A numeric expression to be rounded\ndecimal_places\nOptional. The number of decimal places to round the expression to. If \n    omitted, the function rounds to the nearest whole number\nTechnical Details\nWorks in:\nFrom Access 2000\n\n\u276f\n\u2605\n+1",
