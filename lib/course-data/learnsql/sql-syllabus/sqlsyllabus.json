It is updated and improved frequently.\nThe syllabus outline and its sequence are structured so you can learn SQL step by step, from the introduction to creating your first application with SQL.\nGet Started With SQL \u00bb\nLearning Outcomes\nUnderstand what SQL is and why you would use it.\nCreate and manage databases and tables.\nInsert, update, and delete data in tables.\nUse SELECT with filters (WHERE) and sorting (ORDER BY) to get data.\nUse JOIN to combine data from multiple tables.\nUse functions like SUM, AVG, and COUNT to group data and add them up.\nCreate table relationships with foreign keys.\nUse SQL functions like MIN, MAX, and COUNT.\nUnderstand subqueries and indexes.\nManage user permissions and data security.\nNote:\nAre you a teacher teaching SQL?\n Academy\nis a toolbox of features that can help you teach. It offers classroom features such as pre-built study plans, classroom administration and much more. Read more about\nAcademy here\n.\nWhich Subjects Are SQL Relevant For?\nInformation Technology (IT):\nSQL is used to run and manage databases and IT systems.\nComputer Science (CS):\nLearn database management and data structures.\nData Science:\nSQL is foundational for data analysis and handling of big data.\nMathematics:\nOrganize and analyze data.\nBusiness and Management:\nSQL supports reporting and data-driven decision making.\nEconomics and Finance:\nPulling raw data from databases. Financial data management, reporting, and risk analysis.\nStatistics:\nCollecting and processing of large data sets.\nScience (Biology, Chemistry, and more):\nHandling, research, and analysis of experimental data.\nRetail and E-commerce:\nAnalysis of inventory, supply chain management, and sales. Customer database management.\nOther (Healthcare, Education, Engineering):\nUser record systems, data analysis, quality control, and data monitoring.\nSQL is a language that is essential in any subject working with data.\nGet Started\nActivities\nIn this tutorial we offer different activities for you to learn SQL for free:\nLessons\nExercises\nQuizzes\nSign in to Track Progress\nYou can also create a free account to \nAs a signed-in user, you get access to features such as:\nLearning paths\nSandbox and lab environments\nAchievements\nAnd much more!\n\nOverview of the Modules\nSQL Introduction\nSQL Syntax\nSQL SELECT\nSQL SELECT DISTINCT\nSQL WHERE\nSQL ORDER BY\nSQL AND, OR, NOT\nSQL INSERT INTO\nSQL NULL Values\nSQL UPDATE\nSQL DELETE\nSQL SELECT TOP\nAggregate Functions\nSQL MIN and MAX\nSQL COUNT, AVG, SUM\nSQL LIKE\nSQL Wildcards\nSQL IN\nSQL BETWEEN\nSQL Aliases\nSQL Joins\nSQL INNER JOIN\nSQL LEFT JOIN\nSQL RIGHT JOIN\nSQL FULL JOIN\nSQL Self Join\nSQL UNION\nSQL GROUP BY\nSQL HAVING\nSQL EXISTS\nSQL ANY and ALL\nSQL SELECT INTO\nSQL INSERT INTO SELECT\nSQL CASE\nSQL NULL Functions\nSQL Stored Procedures\nSQL Comments\nSQL Operators\nSQL Database\nSQL Drop DB\nSQL Backup DB\nSQL CREATE TABLE\nSQL Drop Table\nSQL Alter Table\nSQL Constraints\nSQL Unique\nSQL Primary Key\nSQL CHECK Constraint\nSQL Default Constraint\nSQL Create Index Statement\nSQL Auto Increment\nSQL Dates\nSQL Views\nSQL Injections\nSQL Hosting\nSQL Data Types\nGet Started\nSandbox and Lab Environment\nSQL, like any other coding language, is best learned by working hands-on with code.\nWith our online SQL editor, you can edit the SQL statements, and view the result in your browser:\nExample\nSELECT * FROM Customers;\n\nIf you want to explore more and host your project, we have a feature called\nSpaces\nthat allows you to build, test and deploy static websites for free.\nHere you get a secure sandbox environment called Spaces, where you can practice coding and test projects in real-time.\nSpaces allow you to test, build, and deploy code. This includes a  subdomain, hosting, and secure SSL certificates.\nSpaces require no installation and run directly in the browser.\nFeatures include:\nCollaboration\nFile navigator\nTerminal & log\nPackage manager\nDatabase\nEnvironment manager\nAnalytics\nCreate a Spaces Account\nSQL Certification\n offers an end-of-pathway certification program.\nHere you can take exams to get certified.\nThe SQL exam is a test that summarizes the  SQL syllabus.\nAfter passing the exam you get the \"Certified SQL Developer\" Certification.\nThere are two different types of certifications:\nNon-adaptive\nAdaptive\nThe non-adaptive is pass or no pass.\nThe adaptive certification is adaptive and graded; students will get a grade from intermediate, advanced to professional.\nBuy Certificate \u00bb\nAre You a Teacher?\nAre you interested in learning how you can use\n Academy\nto Teach \nSQL?\nWatch a demo of\n Academy\n.
