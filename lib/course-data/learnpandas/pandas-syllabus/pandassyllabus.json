It is updated\n  and improved frequently.\nThe syllabus outline and its sequence are structured so you can learn Pandas\n  step by step, from the introduction to data analysis.\nGet Started With Pandas \u00bb\nLearning Outcomes\nUnderstand the basic structure of Pandas DataFrames and Series.\nLoad and manipulate data from various sources.\nClean and preprocess data effectively.\nPerform data analysis and aggregation.\nHandle missing data appropriately.\nCreate data visualizations.\nWork with time series data.\nMerge and join datasets.\nExport data to different formats.\nNote:\nAre you a teacher teaching Pandas?\n Academy\nis a toolbox of features that can help you teach. It offers classroom\n    features such as pre-built study plans, classroom administration and much\n    more. Read more about\nAcademy here\n.\nWhich Subjects Are Pandas Relevant For?\nData Analysis:\nPandas is essential for data manipulation and analysis.\nData Science:\nPandas is fundamental for data preparation and exploration.\nBusiness Analytics:\nPandas helps analyze business data and create reports.\nFinance:\nPandas is perfect for financial data analysis and time series.\nResearch:\nPandas supports data cleaning and statistical analysis.\nMachine Learning:\nPandas is crucial for data preprocessing in ML projects.\nData Engineering:\nPandas helps in data transformation and ETL processes.\nGet Started\nActivities\nIn this tutorial we offer different activities for you to learn Pandas for\n  free:\nLessons\nExercises\nQuizzes\nSign in to Track Progress\nYou can also create a free account to \nAs a signed-in user, you get access to features such as:\nLearning paths\nSandbox and lab environments\nAchievements\nAnd much more!\n\nOverview of the Modules\nPandas HOME\nPandas Intro\nPandas Getting Started\nPandas Series\nPandas DataFrames\nPandas Read CSV\nPandas Read JSON\nPandas Analyzing Data\nCleaning Data\nCleaning Empty Cells\nCleaning Wrong Format\nCleaning Wrong Data\nRemoving Duplicates\nPandas Correlations\nPandas Plotting\nDataFrames Reference\nGet Started\nSandbox and Lab Environment\nPandas, like any other library, is best learned through hands-on practice.\nTry this example using our editor:\nExample\nLoad a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame:\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\nprint(df.to_string())\n\nIf you want to explore more and host your project, we have a feature called\nSpaces\nthat allows you to\n  build, test and deploy Python projects for free.\nHere you get a secure sandbox environment called Spaces, where you can\n  practice Pandas code and test projects in real-time.\nSpaces allow you to test, build, and deploy code. This includes a \n  subdomain, hosting, and secure SSL certificates.\nSpaces require no installation and run directly in the browser.\nFeatures include:\nCollaboration\nFile navigator\nTerminal & log\nPackage manager\nDatabase\nEnvironment manager\nAnalytics\nCreate a Spaces Account\nPandas Certification\n offers an end-of-pathway certification program.\nHere you can take exams to get certified.\nThe Pandas exam is a test that summarizes the  Pandas syllabus.\nAfter passing the exam you get the \"Certified Pandas Developer\" Certification.\nThere are two different types of certifications:\nNon-adaptive\nAdaptive\nThe non-adaptive is pass or no pass.\nThe adaptive certification is adaptive and graded; students will get a grade\n  from intermediate, advanced to professional.\nBuy Certificate \u00bb\nAre You a Teacher?\nAre you interested in learning how you can use\n Academy\nto Teach Pandas?\nWatch a demo of\n Academy\n.\n  You'll see how it works, and discover how it can make teaching programming\n  easier and more engaging.\nWatch Demo \u00bb\n\n\u2605\n+1",
