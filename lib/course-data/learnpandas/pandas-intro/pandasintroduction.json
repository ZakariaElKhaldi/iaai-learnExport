Like:\nIs there a correlation between two or more columns?\nWhat is average value?\nMax value?\nMin value?\nPandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong \nvalues, like empty or NULL values. This is called\ncleaning\nthe data.\nWhere is the Pandas Codebase?\nThe source code for Pandas is located at this github repository\n\n{:\ngithub:\nenables many people to work on the same \n  codebase.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
