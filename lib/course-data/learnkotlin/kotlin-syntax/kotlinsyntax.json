A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. In the example above, it declares the\nmain()\nfunction.\nThe\nmain()\nfunction is something you will \nsee in every Kotlin program. This function is used to\nexecute\ncode. Any code inside the\nmain()\nfunction's curly brackets\n{}\nwill be\nexecuted\n.\nFor example, the\nprintln()\nfunction is inside the\nmain()\nfunction, meaning that this will be executed. The\nprintln()\nfunction is used to output/print text, and in our example it will output \"Hello World\".\nGood To Know:\nIn Kotlin, code statements do not have to end with a semicolon (\n;\n) (which is often required for other programming languages, such as\nJava\n,\nC++\n,\nC#\n, etc.).\nMain Parameters\nBefore Kotlin version 1.3, it was required to use the\nmain()\nfunction with parameters, like:\nfun main(args : Array<String>)\n. \nThe example above had to be written like this to work:\nExample\nfun main(args : Array<String>) {\n  println(\"Hello World\")\n}\n\nNote:\nThis is no longer required, and the program will run fine without it. However, it will not do any harm if you have been using it in the past, and will continue to use it.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
