Click on the \"Project JDK\" menu, select \"Download JDK\" and select a version and vendor (e.g. AdoptOpenJDK 11)\nand click on the \"Download\" button:\nWhen the JDK is downloaded and installed, choose it from the select menu and \nthen click on the \"\nNow we can start working with our Kotlin project. Do not worry about all of the different buttons and functions in \nIntelliJ. For now, just open the src (source) folder, and follow the same steps as in the image below, to create a kotlin file:\nSelect the \"File\" option and add a name to your Kotlin file, for example \"Main\":\nYou have now created your first Kotlin file (Main.kt). Let's add some Kotlin code to it, and run the program to see how it works. Inside the Main.kt file, add the following code:\nMain.kt\nfun main() {\n  println(\"Hello World\")\n}\nDon't worry if you don't understand the code above - we will discuss it in detail in later chapters. For now, lets focus on how to run the code. Click on the Run button \nat the top navigation bar, then click \"Run\", and select \"Mainkt\".\n\nwill look something like this:\nAs you can see, the output of the code was \"Hello World\", meaning that you have now written and executed your first Kotlin program!\nLearning Kotlin At \nWhen learning Kotlin at .com, you can use our \"\nyou to understand every part as we move forward:\nMain.kt\nCode:\nfun main() {\n  println(\"Hello World\")\n}\nResult:\nHello World\n\n\u2605\n+1",
