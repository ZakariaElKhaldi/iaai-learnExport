You should extract out the codes that are \ncommon for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them \ninstead of repeating it.\nKotlin - What are Classes and Objects?\nClasses and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.\nLook at the following illustration to see the difference between class and \nobjects:\nclass\nFruit\nobjects\nApple\nBanana\nMango\nAnother example:\nclass\nCar\nobjects\nVolvo\nAudi\nToyota\nSo, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.\nWhen the individual objects are created, they inherit all the \nvariables and methods from the class.\nYou will learn much more about\nclasses and objects\nin the\n\n\u2605\n+1",
