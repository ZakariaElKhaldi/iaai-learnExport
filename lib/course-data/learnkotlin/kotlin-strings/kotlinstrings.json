      "content": "Kotlin Strings\nStrings are used for storing text.\nA string contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes:\nExample\nvar greeting = \"Hello\"\n\nUnlike\nJava\n, you do not have to specify that the variable should be a\nString\n. Kotlin is smart enough to understand that the greeting variable in the example \nabove is a\nString\nbecause of the double quotes.\nHowever, just like with other data types, you can specify the type if you insist:\nExample\nvar greeting: String = \"Hello\"\n\nNote:\nIf you want to create a\nString\nwithout assigning the value (and assign the value later), you must specify the type while declaring the variable:\nExample\nThis works fine:\nvar name: String\nname = \"John\"\nprintln(name)\n\nExample\nThis will generate an error:\nvar name\nname = \"John\"\nprintln(name)\n\nAccess a String\nTo access the characters (elements) of a string, you must refer to the\nindex number\ninside\nsquare brackets.\nString indexes start with 0. In the example below, we access the first and third element in\ntxt\n:\nExample\nvar txt = \"Hello World\"\nprintln(txt[0]) // first element (H)\nprintln(txt[2]) // third element (l)\n\n[0] is the first element. [1] is the second element, [2] is the third element, etc.\nString Length\nA String in Kotlin is an object, which contain properties and functions that can perform certain operations on strings, \nby writing a dot character (\n.\n) after the specific string variable. For example, the length of a string can be found with the\nlength\nproperty:\nExample\nvar txt = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\nprintln(\"The length of the txt string is: \" + txt.length)\n\nString Functions\nThere are many string functions available, for example\ntoUpperCase()\nand\ntoLowerCase()\n:\nExample\nvar txt = \"Hello World\"\nprintln(txt.toUpperCase())\u00a0\u00a0 // Outputs \"HELLO WORLD\"\nprintln(txt.toLowerCase())\u00a0\u00a0 // Outputs \"hello world\"\n\nComparing Strings\nThe\ncompareTo(\nstring\n)\nfunction \ncompares two strings and returns 0 if both are equal:\nExample\nvar txt1 = \"Hello World\"\nvar txt2 = \"Hello World\"\nprintln(txt1.compareTo(txt2))\u00a0 // Outputs 0 (they are equal)\n\nFinding a String in a String\nThe\nindexOf()\nfunction returns the\nindex\n(the position) \nof the first occurrence of a specified text in a string \n(including whitespace):\nExample\nvar txt = \"Please locate where 'locate' occurs!\"\nprintln(txt.indexOf(\"locate\"))\u00a0 // Outputs 7\n\nRemember that Kotlin counts positions from zero.\n0 is the first position in a \nstring, 1 is the second, 2 is the third ...\nQuotes Inside a String\nTo use quotes inside a string, use single quotes (\n'\n):\nExample\nvar txt1 = \"It's alright\"\nvar txt2 = \"That's great\"\n\nString Concatenation\nThe\n+\noperator can be used between strings to add them together to make a new \nstring. This is called\nconcatenation\n:\nExample\nvar firstName = \"John\"\nvar lastName = \"Doe\"\nprintln(firstName + \" \" + lastName)\n\nNote that we have added an empty text (\" \") to create a space between firstName and lastName on print.\nYou can also use the\nplus()\nfunction to concatenate two strings:\nExample\nvar firstName = \"John \"\nvar lastName = \"Doe\"\nprintln(firstName.plus(lastName))\n\nString Templates/Interpolation\nInstead of concatenation, you can also use \"string templates\", which is an \neasy way to add variables and expressions inside a string.\nJust refer to the variable with the\n$\nsymbol:\nExample\nvar firstName = \"John\"\nvar lastName = \"Doe\"\nprintln(\"My name is $firstName $lastName\")\n\n\"String Templates\" is a popular feature of Kotlin, as it reduces the amount \nof code. For example, you do not have to specify a whitespace between firstName \nand lastName, like we did in the concatenation example.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
