If we flip \nthe statement, it means that 75% of all of the training sessions have an average pulse of 100 \nbeats per minute or higher\nThe 75% percentile of Average_Pulse means that 75% of all the training \nsession have an average pulse of 111 or lower. If we flip the statement, it \n  means that 25% of \nall of the training sessions have an average pulse of 111 beats per minute or \nhigher\nTask: Find the 10% percentile for Max_Pulse\nThe following example shows how to do it in Python:\nExample\nimport numpy as np\nMax_Pulse= full_health_data[\"Max_Pulse\"]\npercentile10 = np.percentile(Max_Pulse, 10)\nprint(percentile10)\n\nMax_Pulse = full_health_data[\"Max_Pulse\"] - Isolate the variable Max_Pulse from the full health data set.\nnp.percentile() is used to define that we want the 10% percentile from Max_Pulse.\nThe 10% percentile of Max_Pulse is 120. This means that 10% of all the training sessions have a Max_Pulse of 120 or lower.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
