      "content": "Variance\nVariance is another number that indicates how spread out the values are.\nIn fact, if you take the square root of the variance, you get the standard \ndeviation. Or the other way around, if you multiply the standard deviation by itself, you get the variance!\nWe will first use the data set with 10 observations to give an example of how we can calculate the variance:\nDuration\nAverage_Pulse\nMax_Pulse\nCalorie_Burnage\nHours_Work\nHours_Sleep\n30\n80\n120\n240\n10\n7\n30\n85\n120\n250\n10\n7\n45\n90\n130\n260\n8\n7\n45\n95\n130\n270\n8\n7\n45\n100\n140\n280\n0\n7\n60\n105\n140\n290\n7\n8\n60\n110\n145\n300\n7\n8\n60\n115\n145\n310\n8\n8\n75\n120\n150\n320\n0\n8\n75\n125\n150\n330\n8\n8\nTip:\nVariance is often represented by the symbol Sigma Square: \u03c3^2\nStep 1 to Calculate the Variance: Find the Mean\nWe want to find the variance of Average_Pulse.\n1. Find the mean:\n(80+85+90+95+100+105+110+115+120+125) / 10 = 102.5\nThe mean is 102.5\nStep 2: For Each Value - Find the Difference From the Mean\n2. Find the difference from the mean for each value:\n80 - 102.5 = -22.5\n85 - 102.5 = -17.5\n90 - 102.5 = -12.5\n95 - 102.5 = \n  -7.5\n100 - 102.5 = -2.5\n105 - 102.5 = 2.5\n110 - 102.5 = 7.5\n115 - \n  102.5 = 12.5\n120 - 102.5 = 17.5\n125 - 102.5 = 22.5\nStep 3: For Each Difference - Find the Square Value\n3. Find the square value for each difference:\n(-22.5)^2 = 506.25\n(-17.5)^2 = 306.25\n(-12.5)^2 = 156.25\n(-7.5)^2 = \n  56.25\n(-2.5)^2 = 6.25\n2.5^2 = 6.25\n7.5^2 = 56.25\n12.5^2 = 156.25\n17.5^2 = 306.25\n22.5^2 = 506.25\nNote:\nWe must square the values to get the total spread.\nStep 4: The Variance is the Average Number of These Squared Values\n4. Sum the squared values and find the average:\n(506.25 + 306.25 + 156.25 + 56.25 + 6.25 + 6.25 + 56.25 + 156.25 + 306.25 + \n  506.25) / 10 = 206.25\nThe variance is 206.25.\nUse Python to Find the Variance of health_data\nWe can use the\nvar()\nfunction from Numpy to find the \nvariance (remember that we now use the first data set with 10 observations):\nExample\nimport numpy as np\nvar = np.var(health_data)\nprint(var)\n\nThe output:\nUse Python to Find the Variance of Full Data Set\nHere we calculate the variance for each column for the full data set:\nExample\nimport numpy as np\nvar_full = np.var(full_health_data)\nprint(var_full)\n\nThe output:\n\n\u2605\n+1",
