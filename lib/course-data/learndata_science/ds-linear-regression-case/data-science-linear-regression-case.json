      "content": "Case: Use Duration + Average_Pulse to Predict Calorie_Burnage\nCreate a Linear Regression Table with Average_Pulse and Duration as Explanatory Variables:\nExample\nimport pandas as pd\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\nfull_health_data = pd.read_csv(\"data.csv\", header=0, sep=\",\")\nmodel = smf.ols('Calorie_Burnage ~ Average_Pulse + Duration', data = full_health_data)\nresults \n  = model.fit()\nprint(results.summary())\n\nExample Explained:\nImport the library statsmodels.formula.api as smf. Statsmodels \n  is a statistical library in Python.\nUse the full_health_data set.\nCreate a model based on Ordinary Least Squares with smf.ols(). Notice that \n  the explanatory variable \nmust be written first in the parenthesis. Use the full_health_data data set.\nBy calling .fit(), you obtain the variable results. This holds a lot of \n  information about the regression model.\nCall summary() to get the table with the results of linear regression.\nOutput:\nThe linear regression function can be rewritten mathematically as:\nCalorie_Burnage = Average_Pulse * 3.1695 + Duration * 5.8424 - 334.5194\nRounded to two decimals:\nCalorie_Burnage = Average_Pulse * 3.17 + \nDuration * 5.84 - 334.52\nDefine the Linear Regression Function in Python\nDefine the linear regression function in Python to perform predictions.\nWhat is Calorie_Burnage if:\nAverage pulse is 110 and duration of the training session is 60 minutes?\nAverage pulse is 140 and duration of the training session is 45 minutes?\nAverage pulse is 175 and duration of the training session is 20 minutes?\nExample\ndef Predict_Calorie_Burnage(Average_Pulse, \nDuration):\nreturn(3.1695*Average_Pulse + 5.8434 * Duration - 334.5194)\nprint(Predict_Calorie_Burnage(110,60))\nprint(Predict_Calorie_Burnage(140,45))\nprint(Predict_Calorie_Burnage(175,20))\n\nThe Answers:\nAverage pulse is 110 and duration of the training session is 60 minutes = 365 Calories\nAverage pulse is 140 and duration of the training session is 45 minutes = 372 Calories\nAverage pulse is 175 and duration of the training session is 20 minutes = 337 Calories\nAccess the Coefficients\nLook at the coefficients:\nCalorie_Burnage increases with 3.17 if Average_Pulse increases by one.\nCalorie_Burnage increases with 5.84 if Duration increases by one.\nAccess the P-Value\nLook at the P-value for each coefficient.\nP-value is 0.00 for Average_Pulse, Duration and the Intercept.\nThe P-value is statistically significant for all of the variables, as it is less than 0.05.\nSo here we can conclude that Average_Pulse and Duration has a relationship with Calorie_Burnage.\nAdjusted R-Squared\nThere is a problem with R-squared if we have more than one explanatory variable.\nR-squared will almost always increase if we add more variables, and will never decrease.\nThis is because we are adding more data points around the linear regression function.\nIf we add random variables that does not affect Calorie_Burnage, we risk to falsely conclude that the \nlinear regression function is a good fit. Adjusted R-squared adjusts for this problem.\nIt is therefore better to look at the adjusted R-squared value if we have more than one explanatory variable.\nThe Adjusted R-squared is 0.814.\nThe value of R-Squared is always between 0 to 1 (0% to 100%).\nA high R-Squared value means that many data points are close to the linear regression function line.\nA low R-Squared value means that the linear regression function line does not fit the data well.\nConclusion: The model fits the data point well!\nCongratulations! You have now finished the final module of the data science library.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
