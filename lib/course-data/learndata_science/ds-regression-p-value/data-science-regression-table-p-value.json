      "content": "The \"Statistics of the Coefficients Part\" in Regression Table\nNow, we want to test if the coefficients from the linear regression function has a significant impact on \nthe dependent variable (Calorie_Burnage).\nThis means that we want to prove that it exists a relationship between Average_Pulse and Calorie_Burnage, using statistical tests.\nThere are four components that explains the statistics of the coefficients:\nstd err\nstands for Standard Error\nt\nis the \"t-value\" of the coefficients\nP>|t|\nis called the \"P-value\"\n[0.025\u00a0 0.975]\nrepresents the confidence interval of the coefficients\nWe will focus on understanding the \"P-value\" in this module.\nThe P-value\nThe P-value is a statistical number to conclude if there is a relationship between Average_Pulse and Calorie_Burnage.\nWe test if the true value of the coefficient is equal to zero (no relationship). The statistical test for this is called Hypothesis testing.\nA low P-value (< 0.05) means that the coefficient is likely not to equal zero.\nA high P-value (> 0.05) means that we cannot conclude that the explanatory variable affects the dependent variable (here: if Average_Pulse affects \nCalorie_Burnage).\nA high P-value is also called an insignificant P-value.\nHypothesis Testing\nHypothesis testing is a statistical procedure to test if your results are valid.\nIn our example, we are testing if the true coefficient of Average_Pulse and the intercept is equal to zero.\nHypothesis test has two statements. The null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.\nThe null hypothesis can be shortly written as H0\nThe alternative hypothesis can be shortly written as HA\nMathematically written:\nH0: Average_Pulse = 0\nHA: Average_Pulse \u2260 0\nH0: Intercept = \n0\nHA: Intercept \u2260 0\nThe sign \u2260 means \"not equal to\"\nHypothesis Testing and P-value\nThe null hypothesis can either be rejected or not.\nIf we reject the null hypothesis, we conclude that it exist a relationship between Average_Pulse and Calorie_Burnage. The P-value is \nused for this conclusion.\nA common threshold of the P-value is 0.05.\nNote:\nA P-value of 0.05 means that 5% of the times, we will falsely reject the null hypothesis. It means that we accept that 5% of the times, we \nmight falsely have concluded a relationship.\nIf the P-value is lower than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that it exist a relationship between the variables.\nHowever, the P-value of Average_Pulse is 0.824. So, we cannot conclude a relationship between Average_Pulse \nand Calorie_Burnage.\nIt means that there is a 82.4% chance that the true coefficient of Average_Pulse is zero.\nThe intercept is used to adjust the regression function's ability to predict more precisely. It is therefore \nuncommon to interpret the P-value of the intercept.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
