Standard deviation is a measure of uncertainty.\nA low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value.\nA high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range.\nTip:\nStandard Deviation is often represented by the symbol Sigma: \u03c3\nWe can use the\nstd()\nfunction from Numpy to find the standard deviation of a variable:\nExample\nimport numpy as np\nstd = np.std(full_health_data)\nprint(std)\n\nThe output:\nWhat does these numbers mean?\nCoefficient of Variation\nThe coefficient of variation is used to get an idea of how large the standard deviation is.\nMathematically, the coefficient of variation is defined as:\nCoefficient of Variation = Standard Deviation / Mean\nWe can do this in Python if we proceed with the following code:\nExample\nimport numpy as np\ncv = np.std(full_health_data) / np.mean(full_health_data)\nprint(cv)\n\nThe output:\nWe see that the variables Duration, Calorie_Burnage and Hours_Work has a high \nStandard Deviation compared to Max_Pulse, Average_Pulse and Hours_Sleep.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
