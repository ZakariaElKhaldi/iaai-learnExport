      "content": "Correlation Matrix\nA matrix is an array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.\nA correlation matrix is simply a table showing the correlation coefficients \nbetween variables.\nHere, the variables are represented in the \nfirst row, and in the first column:\nThe table above has used data from the full health data set.\nObservations:\nWe observe that Duration and Calorie_Burnage are closely related, with a \n  correlation coefficient of 0.89. This makes sense as the longer we train, the \n  more calories we burn\nWe observe that there is almost no linear relationships between \n  Average_Pulse and Calorie_Burnage (correlation coefficient of 0.02)\nCan we conclude that Average_Pulse does not affect Calorie_Burnage? No. We \n  will come back to answer this question later!\nCorrelation Matrix in Python\nWe can use the\ncorr()\nfunction in Python to create a correlation matrix. We \nalso use the\nround()\nfunction to round the output to two decimals:\nExample\nCorr_Matrix = round(full_health_data.corr(),2)\nprint(Corr_Matrix)\n\nOutput:\nUsing a Heatmap\nWe can use a Heatmap to Visualize the Correlation Between Variables:\nThe closer the correlation coefficient is to 1, the greener the squares get.\nThe closer the correlation coefficient is to -1, the browner the squares \nget.\nUse Seaborn to Create a Heatmap\nWe can use the Seaborn library to create a correlation heat map (Seaborn is a visualization library based on matplotlib):\nExample\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\ncorrelation_full_health = \nfull_health_data.corr()\naxis_corr = sns.heatmap(\ncorrelation_full_health,\nvmin=-1, vmax=1, center=0,\ncmap=sns.diverging_palette(50, \n500, n=500),\nsquare=True\n)\nplt.show()\n\nExample Explained:\nImport the library seaborn as sns.\nUse the full_health_data set.\nUse sns.heatmap() to tell \nPython that we want a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix.\nUse \nthe correlation matrix. Define the maximal and minimal values of the heatmap. \nDefine that 0 is the center.\nDefine the colors with sns.diverging_palette. n=500 \nmeans that we want 500 types of color in the same color palette.\nsquare = True means that we want to see squares.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
