We can say also say that a function uses the relationship between two variables for prediction.\nCorrelation Coefficient\nThe correlation coefficient measures the relationship between two variables.\nThe correlation coefficient can never be less than -1 or higher than 1.\n1 = there is a perfect linear relationship between the variables (like Average_Pulse against Calorie_Burnage)\n0 = there is no linear relationship between the variables\n-1 = there is a perfect negative linear relationship between the variables (e.g. Less hours worked, leads to higher calorie burnage during a training session)\nExample of a Perfect Linear Relationship (Correlation Coefficient = 1)\nWe will use scatterplot to visualize the relationship between Average_Pulse \nand Calorie_Burnage (we have used the small data set of the sports watch with 10 observations).\nThis time we want scatter plots, so we change kind to \"scatter\":\nExample\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nhealth_data.plot(x ='Average_Pulse', y='Calorie_Burnage', \nkind='scatter')\nplt.show()\n\nOutput:\nAs we saw earlier, it exists a perfect linear relationship between Average_Pulse and Calorie_Burnage.\nExample of a Perfect Negative Linear Relationship (Correlation Coefficient = -1)\nWe have plotted fictional data here. The x-axis represents the amount of hours worked at our job before a \ntraining session. The y-axis is Calorie_Burnage.\nIf we work longer hours, we tend to have lower calorie burnage because we are exhausted before the training session.\nThe correlation coefficient here is -1.\nExample\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nnegative_corr = \n  {'Hours_Work_Before_Training': [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1],\n'Calorie_Burnage': \n  [220,240,260,280,300,320,340,360,380,400]}\nnegative_corr = pd.DataFrame(data=negative_corr)\nnegative_corr.plot(x ='Hours_Work_Before_Training', \n  y='Calorie_Burnage', kind='scatter')\nplt.show()\n\nExample of No Linear Relationship (Correlation coefficient = 0)\nHere, we have plotted Max_Pulse against Duration from the full_health_data set.\nAs you can see, there is no linear relationship between the two variables. It \nmeans that longer training session does not lead to higher Max_Pulse.\nThe correlation coefficient here is 0.\nExample\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfull_health_data.plot(x ='Duration', y='Max_Pulse', \nkind='scatter')\nplt.show()\n\n\u2605\n+1",
