      "content": "Mathematical functions are important to know as a data \nscientist, because we want to make predictions and interpret them.\nLinear Functions\nIn mathematics a function is used to relate one variable to another variable.\nSuppose we consider the relationship between calorie burnage and average \npulse. It is reasonable to assume that, in general, the calorie burnage will \nchange as the average pulse changes - we say that the calorie burnage depends \nupon the average pulse.\nFurthermore, it may be reasonable to assume that as the average pulse \nincreases, so will the calorie burnage. Calorie burnage and average pulse are \nthe two variables being considered.\nBecause the calorie burnage depends upon the average pulse, we say that \ncalorie burnage is the dependent variable and the average pulse is the \nindependent variable.\nThe relationship between a dependent and an independent variable can often be \nexpressed mathematically using a formula (function).\nA linear function has one independent variable (x) and one dependent variable \n(y), and has the following form:\ny = f(x) = ax + b\nThis function is used to calculate a value for the dependent variable when we \nchoose a value for the independent variable.\nExplanation:\nf(x) = the output (the dependant variable)\nx = the input (the independant variable)\na = slope = is the coefficient of the independent variable. It gives the \n  rate of change of the dependent variable\nb = intercept = is the value of the dependent \nvariable when x = 0. It is also the point where the diagonal line crosses the \n  vertical axis.\nLinear Function With One Explanatory Variable\nA function with one explanatory variable means that we use one variable for \nprediction.\nLet us say we want to predict calorie burnage using average pulse. We have \nthe following formula:\nf(x) = 2x + 80\nHere, the numbers and variables means:\nf(x) = The output. This number is where we get the predicted value of \n  Calorie_Burnage\nx = The input, which is Average_Pulse\n2 = Slope = Specifies how much Calorie_Burnage increases if Average_Pulse \n  increases by one. It tells us how \"steep\" the diagonal line is\n80 = Intercept = A fixed value. It is the value of the dependent variable \n  when x = 0\nPlotting a Linear Function\nThe term linearity means a \"straight line\". So, if you show a linear function \ngraphically, the line will always be a straight line. The line can slope \nupwards, downwards, and in some cases may be horizontal or vertical.\nHere is a graphical representation of the mathematical function above:\nGraph Explanations:\nThe horizontal axis is generally called the x-axis. Here, it \nrepresents Average_Pulse.\nThe vertical axis is generally called \nthe y-axis. Here, it represents Calorie_Burnage.\nCalorie_Burnage is a function of Average_Pulse, because \nCalorie_Burnage is assumed to be dependent on Average_Pulse.\nIn other words, we \nuse Average_Pulse to predict Calorie_Burnage.\nThe blue (diagonal) line \nrepresents the structure of the mathematical function that predicts calorie \nburnage.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
