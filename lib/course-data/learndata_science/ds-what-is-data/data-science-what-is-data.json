We must organize the data for analysis purposes.\nStructured Data\nStructured data is organized and easier to work with.\nHow to Structure Data?\nWe can use an array or a database table to structure or present data.\nExample of an array:\n[80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125]\nThe following example shows how to create an array in Python:\nExample\nArray = [80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125]\nprint(Array)\n\nIt is common to work with very large data sets in Data Science.\nIn this tutorial we will try to make it as easy as possible to understand the concepts of \nData Science. We will therefore work with a small data set that is easy to interpret.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
