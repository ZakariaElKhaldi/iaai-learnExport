      "content": "The CSS @font-face Rule\nWeb fonts allow Web designers to use fonts that are not installed on the user's computer.\nWhen you have found/bought the font you wish to use, just include the font \nfile on your web server, and it will be automatically downloaded to the user when needed.\nYour \"own\" fonts are defined within the CSS\n@font-face\nrule.\nDifferent Font Formats\nTrueType Fonts (TTF)\nTrueType is a font standard developed in the late 1980s, by Apple and Microsoft. TrueType is the most common font format for both the Mac OS and Microsoft \nWindows operating systems.\nOpenType Fonts (OTF)\nOpenType is a format for scalable computer fonts. It was built on TrueType, \nand is a registered trademark of \nMicrosoft. OpenType fonts are used commonly today on the major \ncomputer platforms.\nThe Web Open Font Format (WOFF)\nWOFF is a font format for use in web pages. It was developed in 2009, and is \nnow a W3C Recommendation. WOFF is essentially OpenType or TrueType with \ncompression and additional metadata. The goal is to support font distribution \nfrom a server to a client over a network with bandwidth constraints.\nThe Web Open Font Format (WOFF 2.0)\nTrueType/OpenType font that provides better compression than WOFF 1.0.\nSVG Fonts/Shapes\nSVG fonts allow SVG to be used as glyphs when displaying text. The SVG 1.1 \nspecification define a font module that allows the creation of fonts within an \nSVG document. You can also apply CSS to SVG documents, and the @font-face rule \ncan be applied to text in SVG documents.\nEmbedded OpenType Fonts (EOT)\nEOT fonts are a compact form of OpenType fonts designed by Microsoft for use \nas embedded fonts on web pages.\nBrowser Support for Font Formats\nThe numbers in the table specifies the first browser version that fully supports the \nfont format.\nFont format\nTTF/OTF\n9.0*\n4.0\n3.5\n3.1\n10.0\nWOFF\n9.0\n5.0\n3.6\n5.1\n11.1\nWOFF2\n14.0\n36.0\n39.0\n10.0\n26.0\nSVG\nNo\nNo\nNo\n3.2\nNo\nEOT\n6.0\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n*IE: The font format only works when set to be \"installable\".\nUsing The Font You Want\nIn the\n@font-face\nrule; first define a name for the font (e.g. myFirstFont) and then point to the font file.\nTip:\nAlways use lowercase letters for the font URL. Uppercase letters can give unexpected results in IE.\nTo use the font for an HTML element, refer to the name of the font (myFirstFont) through the\nfont-family\nproperty:\nExample\n@font-face\n{\nfont-family: myFirstFont;\nsrc: url(sansation_light.woff);\n}\ndiv\n{\nfont-family: myFirstFont;\n}\n\nUsing Bold Text\nYou must add another\n@font-face\nrule containing descriptors for bold text:\nExample\n@font-face\n{\nfont-family: myFirstFont;\nsrc: url(sansation_bold.woff);\nfont-weight: bold;\n}\n\nThe file \"sansation_bold.woff\" is another font file, that contains the bold characters for the Sansation font.\nBrowsers will use this whenever a piece of text with the font-family \"myFirstFont\" should render as bold.\nThis way you can have many\n@font-face\nrules for the same font.\nCSS Font Descriptors\nThe following table lists all the font descriptors that can be defined inside the\n@font-face\nrule:\nDescriptor\nValues\nDescription\nfont-family\nname\nRequired. Defines a name for the font\nsrc\nURL\nRequired. Defines the URL of the font file\nfont-stretch\nnormal\ncondensed\nultra-condensed\nextra-condensed\nsemi-condensed\nexpanded\nsemi-expanded\nextra-expanded\nultra-expanded\nOptional. Defines how the font should be stretched. Default is \n\"normal\"\nfont-style\nnormal\nitalic\noblique\nOptional. Defines how the font should be styled. Default is \n\"normal\"\nfont-weight\nnormal\nbold\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\nOptional. Defines the boldness of the font. Default is \"normal\"\nunicode-range\nunicode-range\nOptional. Defines the range of UNICODE characters the font supports. \nDefault is \"U+0-10FFFF\"\n\n\u2605\n+1",
