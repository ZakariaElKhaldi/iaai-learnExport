It can control the layout of \n  multiple web pages all at once\nExternal stylesheets are stored in CSS files\nCSS Demo - One HTML Page - Multiple Styles!\nHere we will show one HTML page displayed with four different stylesheets. \nClick on the \"Stylesheet 1\", \"Stylesheet 2\", \"Stylesheet 3\", \"Stylesheet 4\" \nlinks below to see the different styles:\nWhy Use CSS?\nCSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout \nand variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.\nCSS Example\nbody\n{\nbackground-color: lightblue;\n}\nh1\n{\ncolor: white;\ntext-align: center;\n}\np\n{\nfont-family: verdana;\nfont-size: 20px;\n}\n\nCSS Solved a Big Problem\nHTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!\nHTML was \ncreated to describe the content of a web page, like:\n<h1>This is a heading</h1>\n<p>This is a paragraph.</p>\nWhen tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 \nspecification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large \nwebsites, where fonts and color information were added to every single  \npage, became a long and expensive process.\nTo solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.\nCSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!\nIf you don't know what HTML is, we suggest that you read our\nHTML Tutorial\n.\nCSS Saves a Lot of Work!\nThe style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.\nWith an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!\nVideo: CSS Introduction\n\n\u2605\n+1",
