Percent depends on its parent font size. EM is relative to the \n  current font size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current \n  font). So, If the font \nsize of body is 16 pixels, then 150% will be 24 pixels (1.5 * 16), and 2em will \n  be 32 pixels (16 * 2). \nLook at\nCSS Units\nfor more \nmeasurement units.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
