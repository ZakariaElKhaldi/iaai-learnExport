It can take the value circle or ellipse. The default value is ellipse.\nThe following example shows a radial gradient with the shape of a circle:\nExample\n#grad {\nbackground-image: radial-gradient(circle, red, yellow, green);\n}\n\nUse of Different Size Keywords\nThe size parameter defines the size of the gradient. It can take four values:\nclosest-side\nfarthest-side\nclosest-corner\nfarthest-corner\nExample\nA radial gradient with different size keywords:\n#grad1 {\nbackground-image: radial-gradient(closest-side at 60% 55%, red, yellow, \nblack);\n}\n#grad2 {\nbackground-image: radial-gradient(farthest-side at 60% \n55%, red, yellow, black);\n}\n\nRepeating a radial-gradient\nThe repeating-radial-gradient() function is used to repeat radial gradients:\nExample\nA repeating radial gradient:\n#grad {\nbackground-image: \nrepeating-radial-gradient(red, yellow 10%, green 15%);\n}\n\n\u2605\n+1",
