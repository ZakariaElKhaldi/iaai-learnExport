But a quick fix.\nSetting The Viewport\nHTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the\n<meta>\ntag.\nYou should include the following\n<meta>\nviewport element in \nthe\n<head>\nsection of all your web pages:\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" \n  />\nThis gives the browser instructions on how \nto control the page's dimensions and scaling.\nThe\nwidth=device-width\npart sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).\nThe\ninitial-scale=1.0\npart sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.\nHere is an example of a web page\nwithout\nthe viewport meta tag, and the same web page\nwith\nthe viewport meta tag:\nWithout the \nviewport meta tag\nWith the \nviewport meta tag\nTip:\nIf you are browsing this page with a phone or a tablet, you can click on the two links above to see the difference.\nSize Content to The Viewport\nUsers are used to scroll websites vertically on both desktop and mobile \ndevices - but not horizontally!\nSo, if the user is forced to scroll horizontally, or zoom out, to see the \nwhole web page it results in a poor user experience.\nSome additional rules to follow:\n1. Do NOT use large fixed-width elements -\nFor example, if \nan image has a width wider than the viewport, it causes the \nviewport to scroll horizontally. Remember to adjust this content to fit within \nthe width of the viewport.\n2. Do NOT let the content rely on a particular width to \nrender well\n- Since screen dimensions and width in CSS pixels vary \nwidely between devices, content should not rely on a particular viewport width \nto render well.\n3. Use CSS media queries to apply different styling for small and \nlarge screens\n- Setting large absolute CSS widths for page elements \nwill cause the elements to be too wide for smaller devices. \nInstead, consider using relative width values, such as width: 100%. Also, be \ncareful of using large absolute positioning values. It may cause the element to \nfall outside the viewport on small devices.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
