      "content": "Gradient Backgrounds\nCSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.\nCSS defines three types of gradients:\nLinear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)\nRadial Gradients (defined by their center)\nConic Gradients (rotated around a center point)\nCSS Linear Gradients\nTo create a linear gradient you must define \nat least two color stops. Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions \namong. You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along \nwith the gradient effect.\nSyntax\nbackground-image: linear-gradient(\ndirection\n,\ncolor-stop1\n,\ncolor-stop2, ...\n);\nDirection - Top to Bottom (this is default)\nThe following example shows a linear gradient that starts at the top. It starts red, transitioning to yellow:\ntop to bottom (default)\nExample\n#grad {\nbackground-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow);\n}\n\nDirection - Left to Right\nThe following example shows a linear gradient that starts from the left. It starts red, transitioning to \nyellow:\nleft to right\nExample\n#grad {\nbackground-image: linear-gradient(to right, red , yellow);\n}\n\nDirection - Diagonal\nYou can make a gradient diagonally by specifying both the horizontal and vertical starting positions.\nThe following example shows a linear gradient that starts at top left (and \ngoes to bottom right). It starts red, transitioning to yellow:\ntop left to bottom right\nExample\n#grad {\nbackground-image: linear-gradient(to bottom right, red, yellow);\n}\n\nUsing Angles\nIf you want more control over the direction of the gradient, \nyou can define an angle, instead of the predefined directions (to bottom, to \ntop, to right, to left, to bottom right, etc.). A value of 0deg is equivalent to \n\"to top\". A value of 90deg is equivalent to \"to right\". A value of \n180deg is equivalent to \"to bottom\".\nSyntax\nbackground-image: linear-gradient(\nangle\n,\ncolor-stop1\n,\ncolor-stop2\n);\nThe following example shows how to use angles on linear gradients:\n180deg\nExample\n#grad {\nbackground-image: linear-gradient(180deg, red, yellow);\n}\n\nUsing Multiple Color Stops\nThe following example shows a linear gradient (from top to bottom) with \nmultiple color stops:\nExample\n#grad {\nbackground-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow, green);\n}\n\nThe following example shows how to create a linear gradient (from left to \nright) with the color of the rainbow and some text:\nRainbow Background\nExample\n#grad {\nbackground-image: linear-gradient(to right, red,orange,yellow,green,blue,indigo,violet);\n}\n\nUsing Transparency\nCSS gradients also support transparency, which can be used to create fading effects.\nTo add transparency, we use the rgba() function to define the color stops. \nThe last parameter in the rgba() function can be a value from 0 to 1, and it \ndefines the transparency of the color: 0 indicates full transparency, 1 \nindicates full color (no transparency).\nThe following example shows a linear gradient that starts from the left. It starts fully transparent, transitioning to full color red:\nExample\n#grad {\nbackground-image: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(255,0,0,0), \nrgba(255,0,0,1));\n}\n\nRepeating a linear-gradient\nThe repeating-linear-gradient() function is used to repeat linear gradients:\nExample\nA repeating linear gradient:\n#grad {\nbackground-image: \nrepeating-linear-gradient(red, yellow 10%, green 20%);\n}\n\n\u2605\n+1",
