No, we cannot!\nSo, you will find HTML pages with\n<section>\nelements \ncontaining\n<article>\nelements, and\n<article>\nelements containing\n<section>\nelements.\nHTML <header> Element\nThe\n<header>\nelement represents a container for introductory content or \na set of navigational links.\nA\n<header>\nelement typically contains:\none or more heading elements (<h1> - <h6>)\nlogo or icon\nauthorship information\nNote:\nYou can have several\n<header>\nelements in one \nHTML document. However,\n<header>\ncannot be placed within a\n<footer>\n,\n<address>\nor another\n<header>\nelement.\nExample\nA header for an <article>:\n<article>\n<header>\n<h1>What Does WWF Do?</h1>\n<p>WWF's mission:</p>\n</header>\n<p>WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of our planet's natural environment,\nand build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.</p>\n</article>\n\nHTML <footer> Element\nThe\n<footer>\nelement defines a footer for a document or section.\nA\n<footer>\nelement typically contains:\nauthorship information\ncopyright \ninformation\ncontact information\nsitemap\nback to top links\nrelated documents\nYou can have several\n<footer>\nelements in one document.\nExample\nA footer section in a document:\n<footer>\n<p>Author: Hege Refsnes</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:hege@example.com\">hege@example.com</a></p>\n</footer>\n\nHTML <nav> Element\nThe\n<nav>\nelement defines a set of navigation links.\nNotice that NOT all links of a document should be inside a\n<nav>\nelement. The\n<nav>\nelement is intended only for major blocks of navigation links.\nBrowsers, such as screen readers for disabled users, can use this element \n  to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of this content.\nExample\nA set of navigation links:\n<nav>\n<a href=\"/html/\">HTML</a> |\n<a href=\"/css/\">CSS</a> |\n<a href=\"/js/\">JavaScript</a> |\n<a href=\"/jquery/\">jQuery</a>\n</nav>\n\nHTML <aside> Element\nThe\n<aside>\nelement defines some content aside from the content it is \nplaced in (like a sidebar).\nThe\n<aside>\ncontent should be \nindirectly related to the surrounding content.\nExample\nDisplay some content aside from the content it is placed in:\n<p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer.
