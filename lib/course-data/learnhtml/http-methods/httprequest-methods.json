      "content": "What is HTTP?\nThe Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable \ncommunications between clients and servers.\nHTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.\nExample: A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server; then the server \nreturns a response to the client. The response contains status information about \nthe request and may also contain the requested content.\nHTTP Methods\nGET\nPOST\nPUT\nHEAD\nDELETE\nPATCH\nOPTIONS\nCONNECT\nTRACE\nThe two most common HTTP methods are: GET and POST.\nThe GET Method\nGET is used to request data from a specified \nresource.\nNote that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of \na GET request:\n/test/demo_form.php?name1=value1&name2=value2\nSome notes on GET requests:\nGET requests can be cached\nGET requests remain in the browser history\nGET requests can be bookmarked\nGET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data\nGET requests have length restrictions\nGET requests are only used to request data (not modify)\nThe POST Method\nPOST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.\nThe data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the \nHTTP request:\nPOST /test/demo_form.php HTTP/1.1\nHost: .com\nname1=value1&name2=value2\nSome notes on POST requests:\nPOST requests are never cached\nPOST requests do not remain in the browser history\nPOST requests cannot be bookmarked\nPOST requests have no restrictions on data length\nCompare GET vs. POST\nThe following table compares the two HTTP methods: GET and POST.\nGET\nPOST\nBACK button/Reload\nHarmless\nData will be re-submitted (the browser should alert the user that the data are about to be re-submitted)\nBookmarked\nCan be bookmarked\nCannot be bookmarked\nCached\nCan be cached\nNot cached\nEncoding type\napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded\napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data. Use multipart encoding for binary data\nHistory\nParameters remain in browser history\nParameters are not saved in browser history\nRestrictions on data length\nYes, when sending data, the GET method adds the data to the URL; and the length of a URL is limited (maximum URL length is 2048 characters)\nNo restrictions\nRestrictions on data type\nOnly ASCII characters allowed\nNo restrictions. Binary data is also allowed\nSecurity\nGET is less secure compared to POST because data sent is part of the URL\nNever use GET when sending passwords or other sensitive information!\nPOST is a little safer than GET because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs\nVisibility\nData is visible to everyone in the URL\nData is not displayed in the URL\nThe PUT Method\nPUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.\nThe difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That \nis, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same \nresult. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of \ncreating the same resource multiple times.\nThe HEAD Method\nHEAD is almost identical to GET, but without the response body.\nIn other words, if GET /users returns a list of users, then HEAD /users will \nmake the same request but will not return the list of users.\nA HEAD request is useful for checking what a GET request will return before \nactually making a GET request - a HEAD request can read the Content-Length \nheader to check the size of the file, without actually downloading the file.\nThe DELETE Method\nThe DELETE method deletes the specified resource.\nThe PATCH Method\nThe PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.\nThe OPTIONS Method\nThe OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target \nresource.\nThe CONNECT Method\nThe CONNECT method is used to start a two-way communications (a tunnel) with \nthe requested resource.\nThe TRACE Method\nThe TRACE method is used to perform a message loop-back test that \ntests the path for the target resource (useful for debugging purposes).\n\n\u2605\n+1",
