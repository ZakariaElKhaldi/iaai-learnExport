      "content": "The\n<div>\nelement is used as a container for other HTML elements.\nThe <div> Element\nThe\n<div>\nelement is by default a \nblock element, meaning that it takes all available width, and comes with line \nbreaks before and after.\nExample\nA <div> element takes up all available width:\nLorem Ipsum <div>I am a div</div>\n  dolor sit amet.\nResult\nLorem Ipsum\nI am a div\ndolor sit amet.\n\nThe\n<div>\nelement has no required attributes, but\nstyle\n,\nclass\nand\nid\nare common.\n<div> as a container\nThe\n<div>\nelement is often used to group sections of a web page together.\nExample\nA <div> element with HTML elements:\n<div>\n<h2>London</h2>\n<p>London is the capital city of England.</p>\n<p>London has over 9 million inhabitants.</p>\n</div>\nResult\nLondon\nLondon is the capital city of England.\nLondon has over 9 million inhabitants.\n\nCenter align a <div> element\nIf you have a\n<div>\nelement that is \nnot 100% wide, and you want to center-align it, set the CSS\nmargin\nproperty to\nauto\n.\nExample\n<style>\ndiv {\nwidth:300px;\nmargin:auto;\n}\n</style>\nResult\nLondon\nLondon is the capital city of England.\nLondon has over 9 million inhabitants.\n\nMultiple <div> elements\nYou can have many\n<div>\ncontainers on the same page.\nExample\n<div>\n<h2>London</h2>\n<p>London is the capital city of England.</p>\n<p>London has over 9 million inhabitants.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Oslo</h2>\n<p>Oslo is the capital city of \n  Norway.</p>\n<p>Oslo has over 700,000 inhabitants.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Rome</h2>\n<p>Rome is the capital city of \n  Italy.</p>\n<p>Rome has over 4 million inhabitants.</p>\n</div>\nResult\nLondon\nLondon is the capital city of England.\nLondon has over 9 million inhabitants.\nOslo\nOslo is the capital city of Norway.\nOslo has over 700,000 inhabitants.\nRome\nRome is the capital city of Italy.\nRome has over 4 million inhabitants.\n\nAligning <div> elements side by side\nWhen building web pages, you often want to have two or more\n<div>\nelements side by side, like this:\nLondon\nLondon is the capital city of England.\nLondon has over 9 million inhabitants.\nOslo\nOslo is the capital city of Norway.\nOslo has over 700,000 inhabitants.\nRome\nRome is the capital city of Italy.\nRome has over 4 million inhabitants.\nThere are different methods for aligning elements side by side, all include some CSS styling.\nWe will look at the most common methods:\nFloat\nThe CSS\nfloat\nproperty was not originally meant to align\n<div>\nelements side-by-side,\nbut has been used for this purpose for many years.\nThe CSS\nfloat\nproperty is used for positioning and formatting content \nand allows elements to be positioned horizontally, rather than vertically.\nExample\nHow to use float to align div elements side by side:\n<style>\n.mycontainer {\nwidth:100%;\noverflow:auto;\n}\n.mycontainer div {\nwidth:33%;\nfloat:left;\n}\n</style>\nResult\nLondon\nLondon is the capital city of England.\nLondon has over 9 million inhabitants.\nOslo\nOslo is the capital city of Norway.\nOslo has over 700,000 inhabitants.\nRome\nRome is the capital city of Italy.\nRome has over 4 million inhabitants.\n\nLearn more about float in our\nCSS float tutorial\n.\nInline-block\nIf you change the\n<div>\nelement's\ndisplay\nproperty from\nblock\nto\ninline-block\n,\nthe\n<div>\nelements will no longer add a line break before and after,\nand will be displayed side by side instead of on top of each other.\nExample\nHow to use display: inline-block to align div elements side by side:\n<style>\ndiv {\nwidth: 30%;\ndisplay: \n  inline-block;\n}\n</style>\nResult\nLondon\nLondon is the capital city of England.\nLondon has over 9 million inhabitants.\nOslo\nOslo is the capital city of Norway.\nOslo has over 700,000 inhabitants.\nRome\nRome is the capital city of Italy.\nRome has over 4 million inhabitants.\n\nFlex\nThe CSS Flexbox Layout Module was introduced to make it easier to design flexible responsive layout\nstructure without using float or positioning.\nTo make the CSS flex method work, surround the\n<div>\nelements with another\n<div>\nelement and give\nit the status as a flex container.\nExample\nHow to use flex to align div elements side by side:\n<style>\n.mycontainer {\ndisplay: flex;\n}\n.mycontainer \n  > div {\nwidth:33%;\n}\n</style>\nResult\nLondon\nLondon is the capital city of England.\nLondon has over 9 million inhabitants.\nOslo\nOslo is the capital city of Norway.\nOslo has over 700,000 inhabitants.\nRome\nRome is the capital city of Italy.\nRome has over 4 million inhabitants.\n\nLearn more about flex in our\nCSS flexbox tutorial\n.\nGrid\nThe CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system,\nwith rows and columns,\nmaking it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.\nSounds almost the same as flex, but has the ability to define more than one row and position each row \nindividually.\nThe CSS grid method requires that you surround the\n<div>\nelements with another\n<div>\nelement and give\nthe status as a grid container, and you must specify the width of each column.\nExample\nHow to use grid to align <div> elements side by side:\n<style>\n.grid-container {\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-template-columns: 33% 33% 33%;\n}\n</style>\nResult\nLondon\nLondon is the capital city of England.\nLondon has over 9 million inhabitants.\nOslo\nOslo is the capital city of Norway.\nOslo has over 700,000 inhabitants.\nRome\nRome is the capital city of Italy.\nRome has over 4 million inhabitants.\n\nLearn more about grid in
