Make your HTML code \nas\nsemantic\nas possible.\nSemantic HTML\nSemantic HTML means using correct HTML elements for their correct purpose as \nmuch as possible. Semantic elements are elements with a meaning; if you need a button, use the\n<button>\nelement (and not a\n<div>\nelement).\nSemantic\n<button>Report an Error</button>\n\nNon-semantic\n<div>Report an Error</div>\n\nSemantic HTML gives context to screen readers, which read the contents of a page out loud.\nWith the button example in mind:\nbuttons have more suitable styling by default\na screen reader identifies it as a button\nfocusable\nclickable\nA button is also accessible for people relying on keyboard-only navigation; \nit can be clickable with both mouse and keys, and it can be tabbed between \n(using the tab key on the keyboard).\nExamples of\nnon-semantic\nelements:\n<div>\nand\n<span>\n- Tells nothing about its content.\nExamples of\nsemantic\nelements:\n<form>\n,\n<table>\n, and\n<article>\n- Clearly defines its content.\nHeadings Are Important\nHeadings are defined with the\n<h1>\nto\n<h6>\ntags:\nExample\n<h1>Heading 1</h1>\n<h2>Heading 2</h2>\n<h3>Heading 3</h3>\n<h4>Heading 4</h4>\n<h5>Heading 5</h5>\n<h6>Heading 6</h6>\n\nSearch engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.\nUsers skim your pages by its headings. It is important to use headings to \nshow the document structure and the relationships between different sections.\nScreen readers also use headings as a navigational \ntool. The different types of heading specify the outline of the page.\n<h1>\nheadings should be used for main headings, followed by\n<h2>\nheadings, then the less important\n<h3>\n, and so on.\nNote:\nUse HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text\nBIG\nor\nbold\n.\nAlternative Text\nThe\nalt\nattribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for \nsome reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the\nsrc\nattribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).\nThe value of the\nalt\nattribute should describe the image:\nExample\n<img src=\"img_chania.jpg\" alt=\"A narrow city street with flowers in Chania\">\n\nIf a browser cannot find an image, it will display the value of the\nalt\nattribute:\nExample\n<img src=\"wrongname.gif\" alt=\"A narrow city street with flowers in Chania\">\n\nDeclare the Language\nYou should always include the\nlang\nattribute inside the\n<html>\ntag, to declare the \nlanguage of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.\nThe following example specifies English as the language:\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<body>\n...\n</body>\n</html>\nUse Clear Language\nAlways use a clear language, that is easy to understand. Also try to avoid characters that \ncannot be read clearly by a screen reader. For example:\nKeep sentences as short as possible\nAvoid dashes. Instead of writing 1-3, write 1 to 3\nAvoid abbreviations. Instead of writing Feb, write February\nAvoid slang words\nCreate Good Link Text\nA link text should explain clearly what information the reader will get by clicking on that link.\nExamples of good and bad links:\nGood\nFind out more about the HTML language\nRead more about\nhow to eat healthy\nBuy tickets to Mars here\n\nBad\nClick here\nRead more..\nBuy tickets to Mars\nhere\n\nNote:\nThis page is an introduction in web accessibility.
