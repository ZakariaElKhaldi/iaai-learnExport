Everything between the\n<!--\nand the\n-->\nwill be hidden from the display.\nExample\nHide a section of HTML code:\n<p>This is a paragraph.</p>\n<!--\n<p>Look at this cool \n  image:</p>\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"pic_trulli.jpg\" \nalt=\"Trulli\">\n-->\n<p>This is a paragraph too.</p>\n\nComments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can \ncomment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors.\nHide Inline Content\nComments can be used to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code.\nExample\nHide a part of a paragraph:\n<p>This <!-- great text --> is a paragraph.</p>\n\nVideo: HTML Comments\n\n\u2605\n+1",
