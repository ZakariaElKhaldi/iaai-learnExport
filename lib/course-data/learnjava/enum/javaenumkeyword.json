Note that they should be in uppercase letters.\nDifference between Enums and Classes\nAn\nenum\ncan, just like a\nclass\n, have attributes and methods. The only \ndifference is that enum constants are\npublic\n,\nstatic\nand\nfinal\n(unchangeable - cannot be overridden).\nAn\nenum\ncannot be used to create objects, and it can not extend other classes (but it can implement interfaces).\nUse enums when you have values that you know aren't going to change, like month days, days, colors, deck of cards, etc.\nRelated Pages\nRead more about enums in our\nJava Enum Tutorial\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
