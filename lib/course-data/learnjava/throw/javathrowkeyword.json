There are many exception types available in Java:\nArithmeticException\n,\nClassNotFoundException\n,\nArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException\n,\nSecurityException\n, etc.\nThe exception type is often used together with a custom\nmethod\n, like in the example above.\nDifferences between\nthrow\nand\nthrows\n:\nthrow\nthrows\nUsed to throw an exception for a method\nUsed to indicate what exception type may be thrown by a method\nCannot throw multiple exceptions\nCan declare multiple exceptions\nSyntax:\nthrow\nis followed by an object (new\ntype\n)\nused inside the method\nSyntax:\nthrows\nis followed by a class\nand used with the method signature\nRelated Pages\nRead more about exceptions in our\nJava Try..Catch Tutorial\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
