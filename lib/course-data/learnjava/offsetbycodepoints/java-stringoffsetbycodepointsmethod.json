These code points will offset the index by more than 1.\nSyntax\npublic int offsetByCodePoints(int\nindex\n, int\ncodePointOffset\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\nindex\nRequired. Specifies the index in the string to measure the offset from.\ncodePointOffset\nRequired. Specifies the number of code points to offset by. Positive values will return a number greater than\nindex\nand negative values will return a number less than\nindex\n.\nTechnical Details\nReturns:\nAn\nint\nrepresenting the index which is\ncodePointOffset\ncode points away from\nindex\n.\nThrows:",
