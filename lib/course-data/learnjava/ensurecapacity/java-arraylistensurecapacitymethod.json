It takes a bit of time to do this, so having this happen with every\nadd()\ncall is not ideal.\nIf you know approximately how many items you are going to add, the\nensureCapacity()\nmethod allows you to increase the capacity of the list just once for multiple\nadd()\ncalls.\nSyntax\npublic void add(int\ncapacity\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\ncapacity\nRequired. Specifies the number of items that the list should be able to hold.\nRelated Pages\nJava Arrays Tutorial\nJava ArrayList Tutorial\n\n\u2605\n+1",
