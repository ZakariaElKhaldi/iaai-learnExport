The radix specifies how many different symbols can be used to represent each digit in a number. For example, a radix of 16 would allow the symbols 0 to 9 and A to F to be used as digits.\nSyntax\npublic Scanner useRadix(int\nradix\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\nradix\nRequired. An\nint\nvalue specifying the radix that the scanner will use to interpret whole numbers.\nTechnical Details\nReturns:\nA reference to the\nScanner\nobject that this method belongs to, which allows for chaining configuration methods. An example of chaining is\nmyObj.useRadix(16).useDelimiter(\",\");\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
