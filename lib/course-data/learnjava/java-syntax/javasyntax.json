In our example, we named the class\nMain\n.\nNote:\nJava is case-sensitive: \"MyClass\" and \"myclass\" has \ndifferent meaning.\nThe name of the java file\nmust match\nthe class name.\nWhen saving the file, save it using the class name and add \".java\" to the end of \nthe filename. To run the example above on your computer, make sure that Java is \nproperly installed: Go to the\nGet Started Chapter\nfor how to install Java. The output should be:\nHello World\nThe main Method\nThe\nmain()\nmethod is required and you will \nsee it in every Java \nprogram:\npublic static void\nmain\n(String[] args)\nAny code inside the\nmain()\nmethod will be executed. \nDon't worry about the keywords before and after it. You will get to know \nthem bit by bit while reading this tutorial.\nFor now, just remember that every Java program has a\nclass\nname which \nmust match the filename, and that every program must contain the\nmain()\nmethod.\nSystem.out.println()\nInside the\nmain()\nmethod, we can use the\nprintln()\nmethod to print a line of text to the screen:\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello World\");\n}\n\nNote:\nThe curly braces\n{}\nmarks the beginning and the end of a block of code.\nSystem\nis a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as\nout\n, \n  which is short for \"output\". The\nprintln()\nmethod, short for \n  \"print line\", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).\nDon't worry too much about how\nSystem\n,\nout\nand\nprintln()\nworks. Just know that you need them \ntogether to print stuff to the screen.\nYou should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (\n;\n).\nVideo: Java Syntax\n\n\u2605\n+1",
