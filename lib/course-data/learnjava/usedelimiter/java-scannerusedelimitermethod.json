A delimiter is the sequence of characters which separates tokens in the data being scanned. It is described by a regular expression given by a string or a\nPattern\nobject.\nLearn more about regular expressions in our\nJava RegEx tutorial\n.\nWhat is a token?\nA token is a sequence of characters separated from other tokens by delimiters. The default delimiter is a block of whitespace characters but it can be changed with this method.\nSyntax\nOne of the following:\npublic Scanner useDelimiter(Pattern\npattern\n)\npublic Scanner useDelimiter(String\npattern\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\npattern\nRequired. A string or\nPattern\nobject. A regular expression defining which sequences of characters are considered delimiters.\nTechnical Details\nReturns:\nA reference to the\nScanner\nobject that this method belongs to, which allows for chaining configuration methods. An example of chaining is\nmyObj.useDelimiter(\",\").setRadix(16);\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
