The way in which arguments \nare formatted depends on the sequence of characters that follows the\n%\nsymbol.\nPlaceholders\nThe placeholders have the form\n%[arg$][flags][width][.precision]conversion\n. The components in [square brackets] are optional.\nAn explanation of each of the components:\narg$\n- Optional. A number followed by a $ sign which indicates which of the additional arguments to use, argument numbers start at 1. This can be replaced with a\n<\nwhich specifies that the argument from the \nflags\n- Optional. A sequence of any of the following characters:\n-\n- Makes the output left-justified by adding any padding spaces to the right instead of to the left.\n+\n- Causes positive numbers to always be prefixed with \"+\".\n- (A space character) This prefixes a space to positive numbers, primarily so that the digits can be lined up with the digits of negative numbers.\n0\n- Pads numbers with zeroes on the left.\n,\n- Groups digits (for example by thousands) and puts separators between the groups.\nwidth\n- Optional. A whole number specifying the minimum number of characters that the output should occupy. If necessary, spaces are added to the left to reach this number, or to the right if the\n-\nflag is used.\n.precision\nOptional. A\n.\nfollowed by a whole number indicating how many decimal digits to show in the formatted data.\nconversion\n- Required. A character which indicates how an argument's data should be represented. If the character is uppercase the data will be formatted in uppercase where possible. The list of possible characters is shown in the table below.\nList of conversions\nCharacter\nConversion\nDescription\n%\nPercent\nDisplays a literal \"%\" character in the output.\nn\nLine break\nDisplays a line break in the output.\nb\nor\nB\nBoolean\nDisplays the boolean value of an argument as \"true\" or \"false\". If \"B\" is used then it displays \"TRUE\" or \"FALSE\" instead.\nc\nor\nC\nUnicode character\nDisplays a unicode character representation of the argument. For whole numbers, this is the unicode character that corresponds to the number. If \"C\" is used then the character will be converted to uppercase where possible.\ns\nor\nS\nString\nDisplays the default string representation of the argument. If \"S\" is used then the string will be converted to uppercase where possible.\nd\nDecimal integer\nRepresents a whole number as a decimal integer.\nh\nor\nH\nUnsigned hexadecimal integer\nRepresents an argument's binary data as an unsigned hexadecimal integer. If \"H\" is used then digits A to F are shown in uppercase.\nNote:\nFor any data other than positive integers this does not represent its real value.\no\nOctal integer\nRepresents a whole number as an octal integer. The \"#\" flag will prefix the number with \"0\".\nx\nor\nX\nHexadecimal integer\nRepresents a whole number as a hexadecimal integer. The \"#\" flag will prefix the number with \"0x\". If \"X\" is used then digits A to F and the letter X are shown in uppercase.\ne\nor\nE\nScientific notation\nRepresents a floating point number in scientific notation. If \"E\" is used then the letter \"E\" of the representation will be uppercase. The \"#\" flag will force a decimal point even if there are no decimal digits.\nf\nFloating point number\nRepresents a floating point number. The \"#\" flag will force a decimal point even if there are no decimal digits.\ng\nor\nG\nGeneral number\nDisplays the shortest representation between\nf\nand\ne\nor\nE\nfor a floating point number.\na\nor\nA\nHexadecimal floating point number\nDisplay a floating point number's internal representation with hexadecimal digits.\nt\nor\nT\nTime or date\nDisplays a formatted date or time. The t or T must be followed by one more character indicating how the date or time should be formatted. If \"T\" is used then text parts of a date or time such as \"JANUARY\" will be uppercase.\nThe following characters can be used for date and time formatting:\nH - 24-hour format of an hour (00 to 23)\nI - 12-hour format of an hour (01 to 12)\nk - 24-hour format of an hour (0 to 23)\nl (lowercase 'L') - 12-hour format of an hour (1 to 12)\nM - Minutes with leading zeros (00 to 59)\nS - Seconds with leading zeros (00 to 59) (The value 60 may occur for leap seconds)\nL - Milliseconds with leading zeroes (000 to 999)\nN - Nanoseconds with leading zeroes (000000000 to 999999999)\np - \"am\", \"pm\", \"AM\" or \"PM\" to indicate morning or afternoon\nz - Difference to Greenwich time (Example: -0800)\nZ - Timezone abbreviations (Examples: EST, MDT)\ns - The seconds since the Unix Epoch (January 1 1970 00:00:00 GMT)\nQ - The milliseconds since the Unix Epoch (January 1 1970 00:00:00 GMT)\nB - A full textual representation of a month (January through December)\nb or h - A short textual representation of a month (three letters)\nA - A full textual representation of a day (Example: Monday)\na - A short textual representation of a day (Example: Mon)\nC - The first two digits of the year (For 1970, \"19\" would be shown)\nY - A four digit representation of a year\ny - A two digit representation of a year\nj - The day of the year with leading zeroes (001 to 366)\nm - A numeric representation of a month (01 to 12)\nd - The day of the month (01 to 31)\ne - The day of the month without leading zeros (1 to 31)\nR - The time in 24-hour format (Example: 21:30)\nT - The time in 24-hour format with seconds (Example: 21:30:02)\nr - The time in 12-hour format with seconds (Example: 09:30:02 PM) (\"AM\" and \"PM\" are always uppercase)\nD - Date representation as month/day/year (Example: 12/17/23)\nF - Date representation as year-month-day (Example: 2023-12-17)\nc - Full date and time (Example: Thu Mar 28 10:51:00 EDT 2024)\nSyntax\nSystem.out.printf(\nlocale\n,\nformatString\n,\nargs\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\nlocale\nOptional. A locale used to determine some of the formatting, such as which characters are used for decimal points and grouping separators.\nformatString\nRequired. A string containing placeholders for the additional arguments \n      indicating how to format them\nargs\nOptional. Any number of additional arguments to the method, their values can be formatted and displayed in the\nformatString\n.\nTechnical Details\nReturns:\nA\nPrintStream\nobject.\nThrows:",
