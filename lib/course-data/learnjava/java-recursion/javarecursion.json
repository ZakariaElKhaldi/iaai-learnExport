      "content": "Java Recursion\nRecursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way\nto break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.\nRecursion may be a bit difficult to understand. The\nbest way to figure out how it works is to experiment with it.\nRecursion Example\nAdding two numbers together is easy to do, but adding a range of numbers is more\ncomplicated. In the following example, recursion is used to add a range of numbers\ntogether by breaking it down into the simple task of adding two numbers:\nExample\nUse recursion to add all of the numbers up to 10.\npublic class Main {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    int result = sum(10);\n    System.out.println(result);\n}\npublic static int sum(int k) {\n    if (k > 0) {\n      return k + sum(k - 1);\n    } else {\n      return 0;\n}\n}\n}\n\nExample Explained\nWhen the\nsum()\nfunction is called, it adds parameter\nk\nto the sum of all numbers smaller\nthan\nk\nand returns the result. When k becomes 0, the function just returns 0. When\nrunning, the program follows these steps:\n10 + sum(9)\n10 + ( 9 + sum(8) )\n10 + ( 9 + ( 8 + sum(7) ) )\n...\n10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + sum(0)\n10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0\nSince the function does not call itself when\nk\nis 0, the program stops there and returns the\nresult.\nHalting Condition\nJust as loops can run into the problem of infinite looping, recursive functions can run into\nthe problem of infinite recursion. Infinite recursion is when the function never stops calling\nitself. Every recursive function should have a halting condition, which is the condition\nwhere the function stops calling itself. In the \nwhen the parameter\nk\nbecomes 0.\nIt is helpful to see a variety of different examples to better understand the concept. In this\nexample, the function adds a range of numbers between a start and an end. The halting\ncondition for this recursive function is when\nend\nis not greater than\nstart\n:\nExample\nUse recursion to add all of the numbers between 5 to 10.\npublic class Main {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    int result = sum(5, 10);\n    System.out.println(result);\n}\npublic static int sum(int start, int end) {\n    if (end > start) {\n      return end + sum(start, end - 1);\n    } else {\n      return end;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThe developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
