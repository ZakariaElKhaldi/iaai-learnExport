This is because it is doing the division y / x.\nSyntax\npublic static double atan2(double\ny\n, double\nx\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\ny\nRequired. The y coordinate of the point to find the angle of.\nx\nRequired. The x coordinate of the point to find the angle of.\nTechnical Details\nReturns:\nA\ndouble\nvalue representing the angle in radians that a point (x, y) makes around the origin (0, 0).\nJava version:\nAny\n\n\u2605\n+1",
