      "content": "Java Constructors\nA constructor in Java is a\nspecial method\nthat is used to initialize objects. \nThe constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to \nset initial values for object attributes:\nExample\nCreate a constructor:\n// Create a Main class\npublic class Main {\n\u00a0 int x;\u00a0 // Create a class attribute\n\n// Create a\nclass constructor\nfor the Main class\n\u00a0 public Main() {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x = 5;\u00a0 // Set the initial value for the class attribute x\n\u00a0 }\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Main myObj = new Main(); // Create an object of class Main (This will\ncall the constructor\n)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(myObj.x); // Print the value of x\n\u00a0 }\n}\n\n// Outputs 5\n\nNote that the constructor name must\nmatch the class name\n, and it cannot have a\nreturn type\n(like\nvoid\n).\nAlso note that the constructor is called when the object is created.\nAll classes have constructors by default: if you do not create a class constructor \nyourself, Java creates one for you. However, then you are not able to set initial values for object attributes.\nConstructor Parameters\nConstructors can also take parameters, which is used to initialize \nattributes.\nThe following example adds an\nint y\nparameter \nto the constructor. \nInside the constructor we set x to y (x=y). When we call \nthe constructor, we pass a parameter to the constructor (5), which will set the value of \nx to 5:\nExample\npublic class Main {\n\u00a0 int x;\n\npublic Main(int y) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x = y;\n\u00a0 }\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Main myObj = new Main(5);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(myObj.x);\n\u00a0 }\n}\n\n// Outputs 5\n\nYou can have as many parameters as you want:\nExample\npublic class Main {\n\u00a0 int modelYear;\n\u00a0 String modelName;\n\npublic Main(int year, String name) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 modelYear = year;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 modelName = name;\n\u00a0 }\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Main myCar = new Main(1969, \"Mustang\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(myCar.modelYear + \" \" + myCar.modelName);\n\u00a0 }\n}\n\n// Outputs 1969 Mustang\n\n\u2605\n+1",
