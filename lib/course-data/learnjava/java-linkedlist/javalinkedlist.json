The\nLinkedList\nclass is \nalmost identical to the\nArrayList\n:\nExample\n// Import the LinkedList class\nimport java.util.LinkedList;\n\npublic class Main {\n\u00a0 public static void main(String[] args) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LinkedList<String> cars = new LinkedList<String>();\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 cars.add(\"Volvo\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 cars.add(\"BMW\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 cars.add(\"Ford\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 cars.add(\"Mazda\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(cars);\n\u00a0 }\n}\n\nArrayList vs. LinkedList\nThe\nLinkedList\nclass is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type,\njust like the\nArrayList\n.\nThe\nLinkedList\nclass has all of the same methods as the\nArrayList\nclass because\nthey both implement the\nList\ninterface. This means that you can add items, change\nitems, remove items and clear the list in the same way.\nHowever, while the\nArrayList\nclass and the\nLinkedList\nclass can be used in the same way,\nthey are built very differently.\nHow the ArrayList works\nThe\nArrayList\nclass has a regular array inside it. When an element is added, it is placed\ninto the array. If the array is not big enough, a new, larger array is created to replace the\nold one and the old one is removed.\nHow the LinkedList works\nThe\nLinkedList\nstores its items in \"containers.\" The list has a link to the first container\nand each container has a link to the \nthe element is placed into a new container and that container is linked to one of the other\ncontainers in the list.\nWhen To Use\nUse an\nArrayList\nfor storing and accessing data, and\nLinkedList\nto \nmanipulate data.\nLinkedList Methods\nFor many cases, the\nArrayList\nis more efficient as it is common to need access to\nrandom items in the list, but the\nLinkedList\nprovides several methods to do certain\noperations more efficiently:\nMethod\nDescription\nTry it\naddFirst()\nAdds an item to the beginning of the list\nTry it \u00bb\naddLast()\nAdd an item to the end of the list\nTry it \u00bb\nremoveFirst()\nRemove an item from the beginning of the list\nTry it \u00bb\nremoveLast()\nRemove an item from the end of the list\nTry it \u00bb\ngetFirst()\nGet the item at the beginning of the list\nTry it \u00bb\ngetLast()\nGet the item at the end of the list\nTry it \u00bb\nComplete LinkedList Reference\nFor a complete reference of LinkedList methods, go to our\nJava LinkedList Reference\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
