If there are two integers that are equally close to the number then the even integer will be returned.\nNote:\nThis method is very similar to\nround()\n. The main differences between\nrint()\nand\nround()\nare:\nround()\nreturns\nlong\nor\nint\ndata types while\nrint()\nreturns a\ndouble\n.\nWhen the decimal part of the number is exactly 0.5,\nrint()\nreturns the nearest even integer while\nround()\nreturns the highest of the two nearest integers\nSyntax\npublic static double rint(double\nnumber\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\nnumber\nRequired. A number to round.\nTechnical Details\nReturns:\nA\ndouble\nvalue representing the nearest integer to a number.\nJava version:\nAny\n\n\u2605\n+1",
