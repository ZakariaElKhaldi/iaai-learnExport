      "content": "Java Threads\nThreads allows a program to operate more efficiently by doing multiple things at the same\ntime.\nThreads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the background without interrupting\nthe main program.\nCreating a Thread\nThere are two ways to create a thread.\nIt can be created by extending the\nThread\nclass and overriding its\nrun()\nmethod:\nExtend Syntax\npublic class Main extends Thread {\n  public void run() {\n    System.out.println(\"This code is running in a thread\");\n}\n}\nAnother way to create a thread is to implement the\nRunnable\ninterface:\nImplement Syntax\npublic class Main implements Runnable {\n  public void run() {\n    System.out.println(\"This code is running in a thread\");\n  }\n}\nRunning Threads\nIf the class extends the\nThread\nclass, the thread can be run by creating an instance of the\nclass and call its\nstart()\nmethod:\nExtend Example\npublic class Main extends Thread {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    Main thread = new Main();\n    thread.start();\n    System.out.println(\"This code is outside of the thread\");\n  }\n  public void run() {\n    System.out.println(\"This code is running in a thread\");\n  }\n}\n\nIf the class implements the\nRunnable\ninterface, the thread can be run by passing an\ninstance of the class to a\nThread\nobject's constructor and then calling the thread's\nstart()\nmethod:\nImplement Example\npublic class Main implements Runnable {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    Main obj = new Main();\n    Thread thread = new Thread(obj);\n    thread.start();\n    System.out.println(\"This code is outside of the thread\");\n  }\n  public void run() {\n    System.out.println(\"This code is running in a thread\");\n  }\n}\n\nDifferences between \"extending\" and \"implementing\" Threads\nThe major difference is that when a class extends the Thread class, you cannot extend any other class, but by implementing the Runnable interface, \nit is possible to extend from another class as well, like: class\nMyClass extends OtherClass implements Runnable\n.\nConcurrency Problems\nBecause threads run at the same time as other parts of the program, there is no way to\nknow in which order the code will run. When the threads and main program are reading\nand writing the same variables, the values are unpredictable. The problems that result\nfrom this are called concurrency problems.\nExample\nA code example where the value of the variable\namount\nis unpredictable:\npublic class Main extends Thread {\n  public static int amount = 0;\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Main thread = new Main();\n    thread.start();\n    System.out.println(amount);\n    amount++;\n    System.out.println(amount);\n}\npublic void run() {\n    amount++;\n}\n}\n\nTo avoid concurrency problems, it is best to share as few attributes between threads as\npossible. If attributes need to be shared, one possible solution is to use the\nisAlive()\nmethod of the thread to check whether the thread has finished running before using any \nattributes that the thread can change.\nExample\nUse\nisAlive()\nto prevent concurrency problems:\npublic class Main extends Thread {\n  public static int amount = 0;\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Main thread = new Main();\n    thread.start();\n    // Wait for the thread to finish\n    while(thread.isAlive()) {\n      System.out.println(\"Waiting...\");\n}\n// Update amount and print its value\n    System.out.println(\"Main: \" + amount);\n    amount++;\n    System.out.println(\"Main: \" + amount);\n}\npublic void run() {\n    amount++;\n}\n}\n\n\u2605\n+1",
