The character must be \nsurrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c':\nExample\nchar myGrade = 'B';\nSystem.out.println(myGrade);\n\nAlternatively, if you are familiar with ASCII values, you can use those to display certain characters:\nExample\nchar myVar1 = 65, myVar2 = 66, myVar3 = 67;\nSystem.out.println(myVar1);\nSystem.out.println(myVar2);\nSystem.out.println(myVar3);\n\nTip:\nA list of all ASCII values can be found in our\nASCII Table Reference\n.\nStrings\nThe\nString\ndata type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). String values must be surrounded by double quotes:\nExample\nString greeting = \"Hello World\";\nSystem.out.println(greeting);\n\nThe String type is so much used and integrated in Java, that some call it \"the special\nninth\ntype\".\nA String in Java is actually a\nnon-primitive\ndata type, because it refers to \nan object. The String object has methods that are used to perform certain \noperations on strings.\nDon't worry if you don't understand the term \"object\" just yet\n. We will learn more about strings and objects in a later chapter.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
