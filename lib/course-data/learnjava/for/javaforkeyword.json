If the condition is true, the loop will start over again, if it is false, \nthe loop will end.\nStatement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has \nbeen executed.\nMore Examples\nThere is also a \"\nfor-each\n\" loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an\narray\n:\nThe following example outputs all elements in the\ncars\narray, using a \"\nfor-each\n\" loop:\nExample\nString[] cars = {\"Volvo\", \"BMW\", \"Ford\", \"Mazda\"};\nfor (String i : cars) {\n\u00a0 System.out.println(i);\n}\n\nRelated Pages\nRead more about for loops in our\nJava For Loop Tutorial\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
