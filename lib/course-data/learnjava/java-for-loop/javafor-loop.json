If the condition is true, the loop will start over again, if it is false, \nthe loop will end.\nStatement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has \nbeen executed.\nAnother Example\nThis example will only print even values between 0 and 10:\nExample\nfor (int i = 0; i <= 10; i = i + 2) {\n\u00a0\u00a0System.out.println(i);\n}\n\n\u2605\n+1",
