If you omit the keyword in the example above, the output would be \"0\" instead of \"5\".\nthis\ncan also be used to:\nInvoke current class constructor\nInvoke current class method\nReturn the current class object\nPass an argument in the method call\nPass an argument in the constructor call\nRelated Pages\nRead more about objects in our\nJava Classes/Objects Tutorial\n.\nRead more about constructors in our\nJava Constructors Tutorial\n.\nRead more about methods in our\nJava Methods Tutorial\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
