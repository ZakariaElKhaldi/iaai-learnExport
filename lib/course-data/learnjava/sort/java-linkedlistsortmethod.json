A\nComparator\ncan be used to compare pairs of elements. The comparator can be defined by a lambda expression which is compatible with the\ncompare()\nmethod of Java's\nComparator\ninterface.\nIf\nnull\nis passed into the method then items will be sorted naturally based on their data type (e.g. alphabetically for strings, numerically for numbers). Non-primitive types must implement Java's\nComparable\ninterface in order to be sorted without a comparator.\nSyntax\npublic void sort(Comparator\ncompare\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\ncompare\nRequired. A comparator or lambda expression which compares pairs of items in the list. Pass\nnull\nto compare items naturally by their data type.\nTechnical Details\nJava version:\n1.8+\nMore Examples\nExample\nUse a lambda expression to sort a list in reverse alphabetical order:\nimport java.util.LinkedList;\n\npublic class Main {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    LinkedList<String> cars = new LinkedList<String>();\n    cars.add(\"Volvo\");\n    cars.add(\"BMW\");\n    cars.add(\"Ford\");\n    cars.add(\"Mazda\");\n    cars.sort( (a, b) -> { return -1 * a.compareTo(b); } );\n    System.out.println(cars);\n  }\n}\n\nRelated Pages\nJava Arrays Tutorial\nJava LinkedList Tutorial\n\n\u2605\n+1",
