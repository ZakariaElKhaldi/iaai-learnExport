The body of the \ninterface method is provided by the \"implement\" class.\nNotes on Interfaces:\nIt\ncannot\nbe used to create objects (in the example above, \nit is not possible to create an \"Animal\" object in the MyMainClass)\nInterface methods does not have a body - the \nbody is provided by the \"implement\" class\nOn implementation of an interface, you must override all of its methods\nInterface methods are by default\nabstract\nand\npublic\nInterface attributes are by default\npublic\n,\nstatic\nand\nfinal\nAn interface cannot contain a constructor (as it cannot be used to create objects)\nWhy And When To Use Interfaces?\nTo achieve security - hide certain details and only show the important \ndetails of an object (interface).\nJava does not support \"multiple inheritance\" (a class can only inherit from one superclass). However, it can be achieved \n  with interfaces, because the class can\nimplement\nmultiple interfaces.\nNote:\nTo implement multiple interfaces, separate them with a comma (see example below).\nMultiple Interfaces\nTo implement multiple interfaces, separate them with a comma:\nExample\ninterface FirstInterface {\n\u00a0 public void myMethod(); // interface method\n}\n\ninterface SecondInterface {\n\u00a0 public void myOtherMethod(); // interface method\n}\n\n// DemoClass \"implements\" FirstInterface and SecondInterface\nclass DemoClass implements\nFirstInterface, SecondInterface\n{\n\u00a0 public void myMethod() {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Some text..\");\n\u00a0 }\n\u00a0 public void myOtherMethod() {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Some other text...\");\n\u00a0 }\n}\n\nclass MyMainClass {\n\u00a0 public static void main(String[] args) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DemoClass myObj = new DemoClass();\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 myObj.myMethod();\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 myObj.myOtherMethod();\n\u00a0 }\n}\n\nRelated Pages\nRead more about interfaces in our\nJava Interface Tutorial\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
