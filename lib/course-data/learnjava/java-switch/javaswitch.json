      "content": "Java Switch Statements\nInstead of writing\nmany\nif..else\nstatements, you can use the\nswitch\nstatement.\nThe\nswitch\nstatement selects one of many code blocks to be executed:\nSyntax\nswitch(\nexpression\n) {\n\u00a0 case x:\n// code block\nbreak;\n\u00a0 case y:\n// code block\nbreak;\n\u00a0 default:\n// code block\n}\nThis is how it works:\nThe\nswitch\nexpression is evaluated once.\nThe value of the expression is compared with the values of each\ncase\n.\nIf there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.\nThe\nbreak\nand\ndefault\nkeywords are optional, and will be described later in this chapter\nThe example below uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:\nExample\nint day = 4;\nswitch (day) {\n\u00a0 case 1:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Monday\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 break;\n\u00a0 case 2:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Tuesday\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 break;\n\u00a0 case 3:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Wednesday\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 break;\n\u00a0 case 4:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Thursday\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 break;\n\u00a0 case 5:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Friday\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 break;\n\u00a0 case 6:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Saturday\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 break;\n\u00a0 case 7:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Sunday\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 break;\n}\n// Outputs \"Thursday\" (day 4)\n\nThe break Keyword\nWhen Java reaches a\nbreak\nkeyword, it breaks out of the switch block.\nThis will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside \nthe block.\nWhen a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.\nA break can save a lot of execution time because it \"ignores\" the execution \nof all the rest of the code in the switch block.\nThe default Keyword\nThe\ndefault\nkeyword specifies some code to run if there is no \ncase match:\nExample\nint day = 4;\nswitch (day) {\n\u00a0 case 6:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Today is Saturday\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 break;\n\u00a0 case 7:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Today is Sunday\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 break;\n\u00a0 default:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Looking forward to the Weekend\");\n}\n// Outputs \"Looking forward to the Weekend\"\n\nNote that if the\ndefault\nstatement is used \nas the last statement in a switch block, it does not need a break.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
