When the exception is thrown we say that the assertion failed.\nAn optional expression can be added which will be used as the exception message if the assertion fails.\nAssertions are disabled by default.\nassert\nstatements are ignored unless assertions are enabled.\nThe purpose of assertions is to clearly mark where a program is doing something unintended when debugging and testing a program.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
