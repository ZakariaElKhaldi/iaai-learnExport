The format of the groupings depends on the locale settings of the scanner, which can be changed with the\nuseLocale()\nmethod.\nIf the\nradix\nparameter is used, then it interprets numbers using the radix. For example, a radix of 16 would interpret numbers as hexadecimal (digits 0 to 9 and A to F). If the\nradix\nparameter is not used then it interprets numbers using the scanner's radix, which is 10 by default but it can be changed with the\nuseRadix()\nmethod.\nWhat is a token?\nA token is a sequence of characters separated from other tokens by delimiters. The default delimiter is a block of whitespace characters but it can be changed with the\nuseDelimiter()\nmethod.\nSyntax\nOne of the following:\npublic boolean has\npublic boolean has\nradix\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\nradix\nOptional. Specifies the radix used to interpret numbers. The radix specifies how many different symbols can be used to represent a digit in a number.\nTechnical Details\nReturns:\nA\nboolean\nvalue which is true if the \nlong\nvalue.\nThrows:",
