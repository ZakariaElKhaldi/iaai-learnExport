After calling the\nclose()\nmethod, the current Scanner object can no longer be used.\nNote:\nClosing a scanner that was created with\nSystem.in\nwill close the\nSystem.in\nstream itself, making it unusable. It is best to only used the\nclose()\nmethod with files.\nSyntax\npublic void close()\nRelated Pages\nJava Tutorial:\nCreate and Write Files\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
