      "content": "What is a Regular Expression?\nA regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.\nWhen you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you\nare searching for.\nA regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.\nRegular expressions can be used to perform all types of\ntext search\nand\ntext replace\noperations.\nJava does not have a built-in Regular Expression class, but we can import the\njava.util.regex\npackage to work with regular expressions. The package includes the following \nclasses:\nPattern\nClass - Defines a pattern (to be used in a search)\nMatcher\nClass - Used to search for the \npattern\nPatternSyntaxException\nClass - Indicates syntax error in a regular \nexpression pattern\nExample\nFind out if there are any occurrences of the word \"\" in a sentence:\nimport java.util.regex.Matcher;\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern;\n\npublic class Main {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(\"\", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE);\n    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(\"Visit !\");\n    boolean matchFound = matcher.find();\n    if(matchFound) {\n      System.out.println(\"Match found\");\n    } else {\n      System.out.println(\"Match not found\");\n    }\n  }\n}\n// Outputs Match found\n\nExample Explained\nIn this example, The word \"\" is being searched for in a sentence.\nFirst, the pattern is created using the\nPattern.compile()\nmethod. The first parameter\nindicates which pattern is being searched for and the second parameter has a flag to\nindicates that the search should be case-insensitive. The second parameter is optional.\nThe\nmatcher()\nmethod is used to search for the pattern in a string. It returns a Matcher\nobject which contains information about the search that was performed.\nThe\nfind()\nmethod returns true if the pattern was found in the string and false if it was not\nfound.\nFlags\nFlags in the\ncompile()\nmethod change how the search is performed. Here are a few of\nthem:\nPattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE\n- The case of letters will be ignored when performing\na search.\nPattern.LITERAL\n- Special characters in the pattern will not have any special\nmeaning and will be treated as ordinary characters when performing a search.\nPattern.UNICODE_CASE\n- Use it together with the\nCASE_INSENSITIVE\nflag to\nalso ignore the case of letters outside of the English alphabet\nRegular Expression Patterns\nThe first parameter of the\nPattern.compile()\nmethod is the pattern. It describes what\nis being searched for.\nBrackets are used to find a range of characters:\nExpression\nDescription\n[abc]\nFind one character from the options between the brackets\n[^abc]\nFind one character NOT between the brackets\n[0-9]\nFind one character from the range 0 to 9\nMetacharacters\nMetacharacters are characters with a special meaning:\nMetacharacter\nDescription\n|\nFind a match for any one of the patterns separated by | as in: cat|dog|fish\n.\nFind just one instance of any character\n^\nFinds a match as the beginning of a string as in: ^Hello\n$\nFinds a match at the end of the string as in: World$\n\\d\nFind a digit\n\\s\nFind a whitespace character\n\\b\nFind a match at the beginning of a word like this: \\bWORD, or at the end of a word like this: WORD\\b\n\\uxxxx\nFind the Unicode character specified by the hexadecimal number xxxx\nQuantifiers\nQuantifiers define quantities:\nQuantifier\nDescription\nn+\nMatches any string that contains at least one\nn\nn*\nMatches any string that contains zero or more occurrences of\nn\nn?\nMatches any string that contains zero or one occurrences of\nn\nn{x}\nMatches any string that contains a sequence of\nX\nn\n's\nn{x,y}\nMatches any string that contains a sequence of X to Y\nn\n's\nn{x,}\nMatches any string that contains a sequence of at least X\nn\n's\n\n\u2605\n+1",
