It is updated and improved frequently.\nThe syllabus outline and its sequence are structured so you can learn Java step by step, from the introduction to creating your first application with Java.\nGet Started With Java \u00bb\nLearning Outcomes\nUnderstand Java and set up a development environment.\nLearn the foundations of Java such as Java syntax, variables, data types, and operators.\nUse control structures (If, for, while loops).\nUnderstand and apply object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts: classes, objects, and inheritance.\nCreate and use methods for modular programming.\nHandle exceptions and write error-handling code.\nWork with Java collections like ArrayList and HashMap.\nWrite and run Java programs.\nNote:\nAre you a teacher teaching Java?\n Academy\nis a toolbox of features that can help you teach. It offers classroom features such as pre-built study plans, classroom administration and much more. Read more about\nAcademy here\n.\nWhich Subjects Are Java Relevant For?\nComputer Science:\nJava is used to teach programming concepts, algorithms, and software development.\nMathematics:\nJava can be used for making algorithms and solving math problems.\nInformation Technology (IT):\nJava is relevant for learning about software development, database management, and IT systems.\nEngineering:\nJava is used in projects involving software engineering and building applications.\nPhysics:\nJava can be used to create simulations.\nRobotics and Electronics:\nJava is often used in programming microcontrollers and robotics projects.\nStatistics:\nJava can be used to analyze data and to do statistical calculations.\nGet Started\nActivities\nIn this tutorial we offer different activities for you to learn Java for free:\nLessons\nExercises\nQuizzes\nSign in to Track Progress\nYou can also create a free account to \nAs a signed-in user, you get access to features such as:\nLearning paths\nSandbox and lab environments\nAchievements\nAnd much more!\n\nOverview of the Modules\nJava HOME\nJava Introduction\nJava Get Started\nJava Syntax\nJava Output\nJava Comments\nJava Variables\nJava Data Types\nJava Type Casting\nJava Operators\nJava Strings\nJava Math\nJava Booleans\nJava If...Else\nJava Switch\nJava While Loop\nJava For Loop\nJava Break and Continue\nJava Arrays\nJava Methods\nJava Method Parameters\nJava Method Overloading\nJava Scope\nJava Recursion\nJava OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)\nJava Classes/Objects\nJava Class Attributes\nJava Class Metods\nJava Constructors\nJava Modifiers\nJava Encapsulation\nJava Packages\nJava Inheritance\nJava Polymorphism\nJava Inner Classes\nJava Abstraction\nJava Interface\nJava Enums\nJava User Input\nJava Date\nJava ArrayList\nJava LinkedList\nJava Link Sorting\nJava HashMap\nJava HashSet\nJava Iterator\nJava Wrapper Classes\nJava Exceptions\nJava Throw\nJava Regular Expressions\nJava Threads\nJava Lambda\nJava Advanced Sorting\nJava File Handling\nJava Create Files\nJava Write to Files\nJava Read Files\nJava Delete Files\nGet Started\nSandbox and Lab Environment\nJava, like any other coding language, is best learned by working hands-on with code.\nEasily try code with our \"\nHere, you can edit Java code and view the result.\nExample\npublic class Main {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    System.out.println(\"Hello World\");\n  }\n}\n\nIf you want to explore more and host your project, we have a feature called\nSpaces\nthat allows you to build, test and deploy Java code and other backend languages.\nHere you get a secure sandbox environment called Spaces, where you can practice coding and test projects in real-time.\nSpaces allow you to test, build, and deploy code. This includes a  subdomain, hosting, and secure SSL certificates.\nSpaces require no installation and run directly in the browser.\nFeatures include:\nCollaboration\nFile navigator\nTerminal & log\nPackage manager\nDatabase\nEnvironment manager\nAnalytics\nCreate a Spaces Account\nJava Certification\n offers an end-of-pathway certification program.\nHere you can take exams to get certified.\nThe Java exam is a test that summarizes the  Java syllabus.\nAfter passing the exam you get the \"Certified Java Developer\" Certification.\nThere are two different types of certifications:\nNon-adaptive\nAdaptive\nThe non-adaptive is pass or no pass.\nThe adaptive certification is adaptive and graded; students will get a grade from intermediate, advanced to professional.\nBuy Certificate \u00bb\nAre You a Teacher?\nAre you interested in learning how you can use\n Academy\nto Teach \nJava?\nWatch a demo of\n Academy\n.
