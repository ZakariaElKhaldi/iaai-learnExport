Note that it will add a new line for each method:\nExample\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello World!\");\nSystem.out.println(\"I am learning Java.\");\nSystem.out.println(\"It is awesome!\");\n\nDouble Quotes\nText must be wrapped inside double quotations marks\n\"\"\n.\nIf you forget the double quotes, an error occurs:\nExample\nSystem.out.println(\"This sentence will work!\");\nSystem.out.println(This sentence will produce an error);\n\nThe Print() Method\nThere is also a\nprint()\nmethod, which is similar to\nprintln()\n.\nThe only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:\nExample\nSystem.out.print(\"Hello World! \");\nSystem.out.print(\"I will print on the same line.\");\n\nNote that we add an extra space (after \"Hello World!\" in the example above) \nfor better readability.\nIn this tutorial, we will only use\nprintln()\nas it makes the code output easier to read.\nVideo: Java Output / Print\n\n\u2605\n+1",
