This loop will \nexecute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will\nrepeat the loop as long as the condition is true.\nNote:\nDo not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise \nthe loop will never end!\nRelated Pages\nRead more about while loops in our\nJava While Loop Tutorial\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
