      "content": "/Objects\nJava is an object-oriented programming language.\nEverything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and \nmethods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has\nattributes\n, such as weight and color, and\nmethods\n, such as drive and brake.\nA Class is like an object constructor, or a \"blueprint\" for creating objects.\nCreate a Class\nTo create a class, use the keyword\nclass\n:\nMain.java\nCreate a class named \"\nMain\n\" with a \nvariable x:\npublic class Main {\n\u00a0 int x = 5;\n}\nRemember from the\nJava Syntax chapter\nthat a class should always start with an uppercase first letter, and that the name of the java file should match the class name.\nCreate an Object\nIn Java, an object is created from a class. We have already created the class named\nMain\n, \nso now we can use this to create objects.\nTo create an object of\nMain\n, \nspecify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keyword\nnew\n:\nExample\nCreate an object called \"\nmyObj\n\" and print the value of x:\npublic class Main {\n\u00a0 int x = 5;\n\n\u00a0 public static void main(String[] args) {",

      "content": "= new Main();\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(myObj.x);\n\u00a0 }\n}\n\nMultiple Objects\nYou can create multiple objects of one class:\nExample\nCreate two objects of\nMain\n:\npublic class Main {\n\u00a0 int x = 5;\n\n\u00a0 public static void main(String[] args) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Main\nmyObj1\n= new Main();\u00a0 // Object 1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Main\nmyObj2\n= new Main();\u00a0 // Object 2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(myObj1.x);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(myObj2.x);\n\u00a0 }\n}\n\nUsing Multiple Classes\nYou can also create an object of a class and access it in another class. This \nis often used for better organization of classes (one class has all the \nattributes and methods, while the other class holds the\nmain()\nmethod (code to \nbe executed)).\nRemember that the name of the java file should match the class name. In this \nexample, we have created two files in the same directory/folder:\nMain.java\nSecond.java\nMain.java\npublic class Main {\n\u00a0 int x = 5;\n}\nSecond.java\nclass Second {\n\u00a0 public static void main(String[] args) {",
