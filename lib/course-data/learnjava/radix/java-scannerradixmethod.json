The radix specifies how many different symbols can be used to represent each digit in a number. For example, a radix of 16 would allow the symbols 0 to 9 and A to F to be used as digits.\nSyntax\npublic int radix()\nTechnical Details\nReturns:\nAn\nint\nvalue representing the radix used by the scanner.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
