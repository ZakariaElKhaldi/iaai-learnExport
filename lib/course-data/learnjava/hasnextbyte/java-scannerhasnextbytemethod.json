For example, a radix of 16 would interpret numbers as hexadecimal (digits 0 to 9 and A to F). If the\nradix\nparameter is not used then it interprets numbers using the scanner's radix, which is 10 by default but it can be changed with the\nuseRadix()\nmethod.\nWhat is a token?\nA token is a sequence of characters separated from other tokens by delimiters. The default delimiter is a block of whitespace characters but it can be changed with the\nuseDelimiter()\nmethod.\nSyntax\nOne of the following:\npublic boolean has\npublic boolean has\nradix\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\nradix\nOptional. Specifies the radix used to interpret numbers. The radix specifies how many different symbols can be used to represent a digit in a number.\nTechnical Details\nReturns:\nA\nboolean\nvalue which is true if the \nbyte\nvalue.\nThrows:",
