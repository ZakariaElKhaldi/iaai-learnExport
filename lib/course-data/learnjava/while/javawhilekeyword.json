This loop will \nexecute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will\nrepeat the loop as long as the condition is true:\nExample\nint i = 0;\ndo {\n\u00a0\u00a0System.out.println(i);\n\u00a0\u00a0i++;\n}\nwhile (i < 5);\n\nRelated Pages\nRead more about while loops in our\nJava While Loop Tutorial\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
