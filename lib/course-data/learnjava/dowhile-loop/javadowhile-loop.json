This loop will \nexecute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will\nrepeat the loop as long as the condition is true.\nSyntax\ndo {\n// code block to be executed\n}\nwhile (\ncondition\n);\nThe example below uses a\ndo/while\nloop. The loop will always be \nexecuted at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code block \nis executed before the condition is tested:\nExample\nint i = 0;\ndo {\n\u00a0\u00a0System.out.println(i);\n\u00a0\u00a0i++;\n}\nwhile (i < 5);\n\nDo not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise \nthe loop will never end!\n\n\u2605\n+1",
