To read other types, look at the table below:\nMethod\nDescription\n\nReads a\nboolean\nvalue from the user\n\nReads a\nbyte\nvalue from the user\n\nReads a\ndouble\nvalue from the user\n\nReads a\nfloat\nvalue from the user\n\nReads a\nint\nvalue from the user\n\nReads a\nString\nvalue from the user\n\nReads a\nlong\nvalue from the user\n\nReads a\nshort\nvalue from the user\nIn the example below, we use different methods to read data of various types:\nExample\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\nclass Main {\n\u00a0 public static void main(String[] args) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Scanner myObj = new Scanner(System.in);\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Enter name, age and salary:\");\n\n// String input\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 String name = myObj.\n\n// Numerical input\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 int age = myObj.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 double salary = myObj.\n\n// Output input by user\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Name: \" + name);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Age: \" + age);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Salary: \" + salary);\n\u00a0 }\n}\nRun Example \u00bb\nNote:\nIf you enter wrong input (e.g. text in a numerical input), you will get an exception/error message (like \"InputMismatchException\").\nYou can read more about exceptions and how to handle errors in the\nExceptions chapter\n.\nComplete Scanner Reference\nTip:\nFor a complete reference of Scanner methods, go to our\nJava Scanner Reference\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
