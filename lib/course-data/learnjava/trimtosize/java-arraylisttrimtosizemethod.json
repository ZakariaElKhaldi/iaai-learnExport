Even if the list does not have 10 items, this space is still reserved. Removing items from a list may leave the space for those items reserved. When you are not using of the capacity of an\nArrayList\nthen there is some wasted memory which can accumulate if your program makes use of many\nArrayList\ns. You can use the\ntrimToSize()\nmethod to recover the unused memory.\nSyntax\npublic void trimToSize()\nRelated Pages\nJava Arrays Tutorial\nJava ArrayList Tutorial\n\n\u2605\n+1",
