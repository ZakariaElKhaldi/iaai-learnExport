      "content": "Interfaces\nAnother way to achieve\nabstraction\nin Java, is with interfaces.\nAn\ninterface\nis a completely \"\nabstract class\n\" \nthat is used to group related methods with empty bodies:\nExample\n// interface\ninterface Animal {\n\u00a0 public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)\n\u00a0 public void run(); // interface method (does not have a body)\n}\nTo access the interface methods, the interface must be \"implemented\" \n(kinda like inherited) by another class with the\nimplements\nkeyword (instead of\nextends\n). The body of the \ninterface method is provided by the \"implement\" class:\nExample\n// Interface\ninterface Animal {\n\u00a0 public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)\n\u00a0 public void sleep(); // interface method (does not have a body)\n}\n\n// Pig \"implements\" the Animal interface\nclass Pig implements Animal {\n\u00a0 public void animalSound() {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 // The body of animalSound() is provided here\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"The pig says: wee wee\");\n\u00a0 }\n\u00a0 public void sleep() {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 // The body of sleep() is provided here\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Zzz\");\n\u00a0 }\n}\n\nclass Main {\n\u00a0 public static void main(String[] args) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pig myPig = new Pig();\u00a0 // Create a Pig object\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 myPig.animalSound();\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 myPig.sleep();\n\u00a0 }\n}\n\nNotes on Interfaces:\nLike\nabstract classes\n, interfaces\ncannot\nbe used to create objects (in the example above, \nit is not possible to create an \"Animal\" object in the MyMainClass)\nInterface methods do not have a body - the \nbody is provided by the \"implement\" class\nOn implementation of an interface, you must override all of its methods\nInterface methods are by default\nabstract\nand\npublic\nInterface attributes are by default\npublic\n,\nstatic\nand\nfinal\nAn interface cannot contain a constructor (as it cannot be used to create objects)\nWhy And When To Use Interfaces?\n1) To achieve security - hide certain details and only show the important \ndetails of an object (interface).\n2) Java does not support \"multiple inheritance\" (a class can only inherit from one superclass). However, it can be achieved \n  with interfaces, because the class can\nimplement\nmultiple interfaces.\nNote:\nTo implement multiple interfaces, separate them with a comma (see example below).\nMultiple Interfaces\nTo implement multiple interfaces, separate them with a comma:\nExample\ninterface FirstInterface {\n\u00a0 public void myMethod(); // interface method\n}\n\ninterface SecondInterface {\n\u00a0 public void myOtherMethod(); // interface method\n}\n\nclass DemoClass implements FirstInterface, SecondInterface {\n\u00a0 public void myMethod() {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Some text..\");\n\u00a0 }\n\u00a0 public void myOtherMethod() {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Some other text...\");\n\u00a0 }\n}\n\nclass Main {\n\u00a0 public static void main(String[] args) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DemoClass myObj = new DemoClass();\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 myObj.myMethod();\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 myObj.myOtherMethod();\n\u00a0 }\n}\n\n\u2605\n+1",
