This prevents incorrect results that can occur from adding really large numbers.\nSyntax\nOne of the following:\npublic static int addExact(int\nx\n, int\ny\n)\npublic static long addExact(long\nx\n, long\ny\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\nx\nRequired. The first number to be added.\ny\nRequired. The second number to be added.\nTechnical Details\nReturns:\nAn\nint\nor\nlong\nvalue representing the sum of two numbers.\nThrows:",
