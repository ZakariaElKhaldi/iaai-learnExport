This is different from an ordinary integer division in that negative results are rounded down away from zero instead of truncated towards it.\nSyntax\nOne of the following:\npublic static int floorDiv(int\ndividend\n, int\ndivisor\n)\npublic static long floorDiv(long\ndividend\n, long\ndivisor\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\ndividend\nRequired. The dividend of the division.\ndivisor\nRequired. The divisor of the division.\nTechnical Details\nReturns:\nAn\nint\nor\nlong\nvalue representing a division between two integers.\nThrows:",
