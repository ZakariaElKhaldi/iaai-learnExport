      "content": "Java Exceptions\nWhen executing Java code, different errors can occur: coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, \nor other unforeseeable things.\nWhen an error occurs, Java will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: Java will throw an\nexception\n(throw an error).\nJava try and catch\nThe\ntry\nstatement allows you to define a block of code to be \ntested for errors while it is being executed.\nThe\ncatch\nstatement allows you to define a block of code to \nbe executed, if an error occurs in the try block.\nThe\ntry\nand\ncatch\nkeywords \ncome in pairs:\nSyntax\ntry {\n\u00a0\u00a0//\nBlock of code to try\n}\ncatch(Exception\ne\n) {\n\u00a0\u00a0//\nBlock of code to handle errors\n}\nConsider the following example:\nThis will generate an error, because\nmyNumbers[10]\ndoes not exist.\npublic class Main {\n\u00a0 public static void main(String[ ] args) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(myNumbers[10]); // error!\n\u00a0 }\n}\nThe output will be something like this:\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 10\nat Main.main(Main.java:4)\nNote:\nArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException\noccurs when you try to access an index number that does not exist.\n\nIf an error occurs, we can use\ntry...catch\nto catch the error and execute some code to handle it:\nExample\npublic class Main {\n\u00a0 public static void main(String[ ] args) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 try {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(myNumbers[10]);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 } catch (Exception e) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }\n\u00a0 }\n}\nThe output will be:\nSomething went wrong.\n\nFinally\nThe\nfinally\nstatement lets you execute code, after\ntry...catch\n, regardless of the result:\nExample\npublic class Main {\n\u00a0 public static void main(String[] args) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 try {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(myNumbers[10]);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 } catch (Exception e) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 } finally {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"The 'try catch' is finished.\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }\n\u00a0 }\n}\nThe output will be:\nSomething went wrong.\nThe 'try catch' is finished.\n\nThe throw keyword\nThe\nthrow\nstatement allows you to create a custom error.\nThe\nthrow\nstatement is used together with an\nexception type\n. There are many exception types available in Java:\nArithmeticException\n,\nFileNotFoundException\n,\nArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException\n,\nSecurityException\n, etc:\nExample\nThrow an exception if\nage\nis below 18 (print \"Access \ndenied\"). If age is 18 or older, print \"Access granted\":\npublic class Main {\n\u00a0 static void checkAge(int age) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if (age < 18) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 throw new ArithmeticException(\"Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old.\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 else {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System.out.println(\"Access granted - You are old enough!\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }\n\u00a0 }\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 checkAge(15); // Set age to 15 (which is below 18...)\n\u00a0 }\n}\nThe output will be:\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.ArithmeticException: Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old.\nat Main.checkAge(Main.java:4)\nat Main.main(Main.java:12)\n\nIf\nage\nwas 20, you would\nnot\nget an exception:\nExample\ncheckAge(20);\nThe output will be:\nAccess granted - You are old enough!\n\nError and Exception Types Reference\nFor a list of different errors and exception types, go to our\nJava Errors and Exception Types Reference\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
