For example, the ulp for\n50000000.0f\nis 4.0, so the \nfloat\ndata type is\n50000004.0f\n.\nNote:\nThe\ndouble\ndata type has a lot more precision than the\nfloat\ndata type, so the ulp is smaller.\nNote:\nLarger numbers have less precision than smaller numbers, that means the ulp is larger.\nNote:\nThe sign of a number does not affect the ulp.\nSyntax\npublic static double ulp(double\nnumber\n)\npublic static float ulp(float\nnumber\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\nnumber\nRequired. A floating point number.\nTechnical Details\nReturns:\nA\ndouble\nor\nfloat\nvalue representing the unit of least precision.\nJava version:\n1.5+\n\n\u2605\n+1",
