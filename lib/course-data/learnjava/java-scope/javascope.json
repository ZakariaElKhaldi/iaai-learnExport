This is called\nscope\n.\nMethod Scope\nVariables declared directly inside a method are available anywhere in the method following the line of code in which they were declared:\nExample\npublic class Main {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n// Code here CANNOT use x\n\nint x = 100;\n\n// Code here can use x\n    System.out.println(x);\n}\n}\n\nBlock Scope\nA block of code refers to all of the code between curly braces\n{}\n.\nVariables\ndeclared inside blocks of code are only accessible by the code between the curly braces, which follows the line in which the variable was declared:\nExample\npublic class Main {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n// Code here CANNOT use x\n\n{ // This is a block\n\n// Code here CANNOT use x\n\nint x = 100;\n\n// Code here CAN use x\n      System.out.println(x);\n\n} // The block ends here\n\n// Code here CANNOT use x\n\n}\n}\n\nA block of code may exist on its\nown or it can belong to an\nif\n,\nwhile\nor\nfor\nstatement.
