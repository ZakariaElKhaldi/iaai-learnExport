      "content": "A population proportion is the share of a population that belongs to a particular\ncategory\n.\nHypothesis tests are used to check a claim about the size of that population proportion.\nHypothesis Testing a Proportion\nThe following steps are used for a hypothesis test:\nCheck the conditions\nDefine the claims\nDecide the significance level\nCalculate the test statistic\nConclusion\nFor example:\nPopulation\n: Nobel Prize winners\nCategory\n: Born in the United States of America\nAnd we want to check the claim:\n\"\nMore\nthan 20% of Nobel Prize winners were born in the US\"\nBy taking a sample of 40 randomly selected Nobel Prize winners we could find that:\n10 out of 40 Nobel Prize winners in the sample were born in the US\nThe\nsample\nproportion is then: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{10}{40} = 0.25\\), or 25%.\nFrom this sample data we check the claim with the steps below.\n1. Checking the Conditions\nThe conditions for calculating a confidence interval for a proportion are:\nThe sample is\nrandomly selected\nThere is only two options:\nBeing in the category\nNot being in the category\nThe sample needs at least:\n5 members in the category\n5 members not in the category\nIn our example, we randomly selected 10 people that were born in the US.\nThe rest were not born in the US, so there are 30 in the other category.\nThe conditions are fulfilled in this case.\nNote:\nIt is possible to do a hypothesis test without having 5 of each category. But special adjustments need to be made.\n2. Defining the Claims\nWe need to define a\nnull hypothesis\n(\\(H_{0}\\)) and an\nalternative hypothesis\n(\\(H_{1}\\)) based on the claim we are checking.\nThe claim was:\n\"\nMore\nthan 20% of Nobel Prize winners were born in the US\"\nIn this case, the\nparameter\nis the proportion of Nobel Prize winners born in the US (\\(p\\)).\nThe null and alternative hypothesis are then:\nNull hypothesis\n: 20% of Nobel Prize winners were born in the US.\nAlternative hypothesis\n:\nMore\nthan 20% of Nobel Prize winners were born in the US.\nWhich can be  expressed with symbols as:\n\\(H_{0}\\): \\(p = 0.20 \\)\n\\(H_{1}\\): \\(p > 0.20 \\)\nThis is a '\nright\ntailed' test, because the alternative hypothesis claims that the proportion is\nmore\nthan in the null hypothesis.\nIf the data supports the alternative hypothesis, we\nreject\nthe null hypothesis and\naccept\nthe alternative hypothesis.\n3. Deciding the Significance Level\nThe significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) is the\nuncertainty\nwe accept when rejecting the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test.\nThe significance level is a percentage probability of accidentally making the wrong conclusion.\nTypical significance levels are:\n\\(\\alpha = 0.1\\) (10%)\n\\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) (5%)\n\\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) (1%)\nA lower significance level means that the evidence in the data needs to be stronger to reject the null hypothesis.\nThere is no \"correct\" significance level  - it only states the uncertainty of the conclusion.\nNote:\nA 5% significance level means that when we reject a null hypothesis:\nWe expect to reject a\ntrue\nnull hypothesis 5 out of 100 times.\n4. Calculating the Test Statistic\nThe test statistic is used to decide the outcome of the hypothesis test.\nThe test statistic is a\nstandardized\nvalue calculated from the sample.\nThe formula for the test statistic (TS) of a population proportion is:\n\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{\\hat{p} - p}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)}} \\cdot \\sqrt{n} \\)\n\\(\\hat{p}-p\\) is the\ndifference\nbetween the\nsample\nproportion (\\(\\hat{p}\\)) and the claimed\npopulation\nproportion (\\(p\\)).\n\\(n\\) is the sample size.\nIn our example:\nThe claimed (\\(H_{0}\\)) population proportion (\\(p\\)) was \\( 0.20 \\)\nThe sample proportion (\\(\\hat{p}\\)) was 10 out of 40, or: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{10}{40} = 0.25\\)\nThe sample size (\\(n\\)) was \\(40\\)\nSo the test statistic (TS) is then:\n\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{0.25-0.20}{\\sqrt{0.2(1-0.2)}} \\cdot \\sqrt{40} = \\frac{0.05}{\\sqrt{0.2(0.8)}} \\cdot \\sqrt{40} = \\frac{0.05}{\\sqrt{0.16}} \\cdot \\sqrt{40} \\approx \\frac{0.05}{0.4} \\cdot 6.325 = \\underline{0.791}\\)\nYou can also calculate the test statistic using programming language functions:\nExample\nWith Python use the scipy and math libraries to calculate the test statistic for a proportion.\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nimport math\n# Specify the number of occurrences (x), the sample size (n), and the proportion claimed in the null-hypothesis (p)\nx = 10\nn = 40\np = 0.2\n# Calculate the sample proportion\np_hat = x/n\n# Calculate and print the test statistic\nprint((p_hat-p)/(math.sqrt((p*(1-p))/(n))))\n\nExample\nWith R use the built-in\nprop.test()\nfunction to calculate the test statistic for a proportion.\n# Specify the sample occurrences (x), the sample size (n), and the null-hypothesis claim (p)\nx <- 10\nn <- 40\np <- 0.20\n# Calculate the sample proportion\np_hat = x/n\n# Calculate and print the test statistic\n(p_hat-p)/(sqrt((p*(1-p))/(n)))\n\n5. Concluding\nThere are two main approaches for making the conclusion of a hypothesis test:\nThe\ncritical value\napproach compares the test statistic with the critical value of the significance level.\nThe\nP-value\napproach compares the P-value of the test statistic and with the significance level.\nNote:\nThe two approaches are only different in how they present the conclusion.\nThe Critical Value Approach\nFor the critical value approach we need to find the\ncritical value\n(CV) of the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)).\nFor a population proportion test, the critical value (CV) is a\nZ-value\nfrom a\nstandard normal distribution\n.\nThis critical Z-value (CV) defines the\nrejection region\nfor the test.\nThe rejection region is an area of probability in the tails of the standard normal distribution.\nBecause the claim is that the population proportion is\nmore\nthan 20%, the rejection region is in the right tail:\nThe size of the rejection region is decided by the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)).\nChoosing a significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) of 0.05, or 5%, we can find the critical Z-value from a\nZ-table\n, or with a programming language function:\nNote:\nThe functions find the Z-value for an area from the left side.\nTo find the Z-value for a right tail we need to use the function on the area to the left of the tail (1-0.05 = 0.95).\nExample\nWith Python use the Scipy Stats library\nnorm.ppf()\nfunction find the Z-value for an \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05 in the right tail.\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nprint(stats.norm.ppf(1-0.05))\n\nExample\nWith R use the built-in\nqnorm()\nfunction to find the Z-value for an \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05 in the right tail.\nqnorm(1-0.05)\n\nUsing either method we can find that the critical Z-value is \\(\\approx \\underline{1.6449}\\)\nFor a\nright\ntailed test we need to check if the test statistic (TS) is\nbigger\nthan the critical value (CV).\nIf the test statistic is bigger than the critical value, the test statistic is in the\nrejection region\n.\nWhen the test statistic is in the rejection region, we\nreject\nthe null hypothesis (\\(H_{0}\\)).\nHere, the test statistic (TS) was \\(\\approx \\underline{0.791}\\) and the critical value was \\(\\approx \\underline{1.6449}\\)\nHere is an illustration of this test in a graph:\nSince the test statistic was\nsmaller\nthan the critical value we do\nnot\nreject the null hypothesis.\nThis means that the sample data does not support the alternative hypothesis.\nAnd we can summarize the conclusion stating:\nThe sample data does\nnot\nsupport the claim that \"more than 20% of Nobel Prize winners were born in the US\" at a\n5% significance level\n.\nThe P-Value Approach\nFor the P-value approach we need to find the\nP-value\nof the test statistic (TS).\nIf the P-value is\nsmaller\nthan the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)), we\nreject\nthe null hypothesis (\\(H_{0}\\)).\nThe test statistic was found to be \\( \\approx \\underline{0.791} \\)\nFor a population proportion test, the test statistic is a Z-Value from a\nstandard normal distribution\n.\nBecause this is a\nright\ntailed test, we need to find the P-value of a Z-value\nbigger\nthan 0.791.\nWe can find the P-value using a\nZ-table\n, or with a programming language function:\nNote:\nThe functions find the P-value (area) to the left side of Z-value.\nTo find the P-value for a right tail we need to subtract the left area from the total area: 1 - the output of the function.\nExample\nWith Python use the Scipy Stats library\nnorm.cdf()\nfunction find the P-value of a Z-value bigger than 0.791:\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nprint(1-stats.norm.cdf(0.791))\n\nExample\nWith R use the built-in\npnorm()\nfunction find the P-value of a Z-value bigger than 0.791:\n1-pnorm(0.791)\n\nUsing either method we can find that the P-value is \\(\\approx \\underline{0.2145}\\)\nThis tells us that the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) would need to be bigger than 0.2145, or 21.45%, to\nreject\nthe null hypothesis.\nHere is an illustration of this test in a graph:\nThis P-value is\nbigger\nthan any of the common significance levels (10%, 5%, 1%).\nSo the null hypothesis is\nkept\nat all of these significance levels.\nAnd we can summarize the conclusion stating:\nThe sample data does\nnot\nsupport the claim that \"more than 20% of Nobel Prize winners were born in the US\" at a\n10%, 5%, or 1% significance level\n.\nNote:\nIt may still be true that the real population proportion is more than 20%.\nBut there was not strong enough evidence to support it with this sample.\nCalculating a P-Value for a Hypothesis Test with Programming\nMany programming languages can calculate the P-value to decide outcome of a hypothesis test.\nUsing software and programming to calculate statistics is more common for bigger sets of data, as calculating manually becomes difficult.\nThe P-value calculated here will tell us the\nlowest possible significance level\nwhere the null-hypothesis can be rejected.\nExample\nWith Python use the scipy and math libraries to calculate the P-value for a right tailed hypothesis test for a proportion.\nHere, the sample size is 40, the occurrences are 10, and the test is for a proportion bigger than 0.20.\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nimport math\n# Specify the number of occurrences (x), the sample size (n), and the proportion claimed in the null-hypothesis (p)\nx = 10\nn = 40\np = 0.2\n# Calculate the sample proportion\np_hat = x/n\n# Calculate the test statistic\ntest_stat = (p_hat-p)/(math.sqrt((p*(1-p))/(n)))\n# Output the p-value of the test statistic (right tailed test)\nprint(1-stats.norm.cdf(test_stat))\n\nExample\nWith R use the built-in\nprop.test()\nfunction find the P-value for a right tailed hypothesis test for a proportion.\nHere, the sample size is 40, the occurrences are 10, and the test is for a proportion bigger than 0.20.\n# Specify the sample occurrences (x), the sample size (n), and the null-hypothesis claim (p)\nx <- 10\nn <- 40\np <- 0.20\n# P-value from right-tail proportion test at 0.05 significance level\nprop.test(x, n, p, alternative = c(\"greater\"), conf.level = 0.95, correct = FALSE)$p.value\n\nNote:\nThe\nconf.level\nin the R code is the reverse of the significance level.\nHere, the significance level is 0.05, or 5%, so the conf.level is 1-0.05 = 0.95, or 95%.\nLeft-Tailed and Two-Tailed Tests\nThis was an example of a\nright\ntailed test, where the alternative hypothesis claimed that parameter is\nbigger\nthan the null hypothesis claim.\nYou can check out an equivalent step-by-step guide for other types here:\nLeft-Tailed Test\nTwo-Tailed Test\n\n\u2605\n+1",
