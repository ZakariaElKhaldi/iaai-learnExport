Relative frequency is the percentage of the total.\nEach category is represented with a slice in the 'pie' (circle). The size of each slice represents the frequency of values from that category in the data.\nHere is a pie chart of the number of people who have won a Nobel Prize in each category up to the year 2020:\nThis pie chart shows relative frequency. So each slice is sized by the percentage for each category.\nSome of the categories have existed longer than others. Multiple winners are also more common in some categories. So there is a different number of winners in each category.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
