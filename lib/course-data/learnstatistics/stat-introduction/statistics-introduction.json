      "content": "Statistics gives us methods of gaining knowledge from data.\nWhat is Statistics Used for?\nStatistics is used in all kinds of science and business applications.\nStatistics gives us more accurate knowledge which helps us make better decisions.\nStatistics can focus on making\npredictions\nabout what will happen in the future. It can also focus on\nexplaining\nhow different things are connected.\nNote:\nGood statistical explanations are also useful for predictions.\nTypical Steps of Statistical Methods\nThe typical steps are:\nGathering data\nDescribing and visualizing data\nMaking conclusions\nIt is important to keep all three steps in mind for any questions we want more knowledge about.\nKnowing which types of data are available can tell you what kinds of questions you can answer with statistical methods.\nKnowing which questions you want to answer can help guide what sort of data you need. A lot of data might be available, and knowing what to focus on is important.\nHow is Statistics Used?\nStatistics can be used to explain things in a precise way. You can use it to understand and make conclusions about the group that you want to know more about. This group is called the\npopulation\n.\nA population could be many different kinds of groups. It could be:\nAll of the people in a country\nAll the businesses in an industry\nAll the customers of a business\nAll people that play football who are older than 45\nand so on - it just depends on what you want to know about.\nGathering data about the population will give you a\nsample\n. This is a part of the whole population. Statistical methods are then used on that sample.\nThe results of the statistical methods from the sample is used to make\nconclusions\nabout the population.\nNote:\nThe word 'statistic' can also refer to specific bits of knowledge; like the average value of something.\nImportant Concepts in Statistics\nPredictions and Explanations\nPopulations and Samples\nParameters and Sample Statistics\nSampling Methods\nData Types\nMeasurement Level\nDescriptive Statistics\nRandom Variables\nUnivariate and Multivariate Statistics\nProbability Calculation\nProbability Distributions\nStatistical Inference\nParameter Estimation\nHypothesis Testing\nCorrelation\nRegression Analysis\nCausal Inference\nWe will cover these topics step by step in this tutorial.\nStatistics and Programming\nStatistical analysis is typically done with computers. Small amounts of data can \nbe analyzed well, \nwithout computers.\nHistorically, all data analysis was performed manually. It was time-consuming and prone to errors.\nNowadays, programming and software is typically used for data analysis.\nIn this course, we will show examples of code to do statistics with the programming languages Python and R.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
