Some are better than others, but they might be harder to do.\nMain Types of Statistical Studies\nThe main types of statistical studies are\nobservational\nand\nexperimental\nstudies.\nWe are often interested in knowing if something is the\ncause\nof another thing.\nExperimental studies are generally better than observational studies for investigating this, but usually require more effort.\nAn observational study is when observe and gather data without changing anything.\nExperimental Studies\nIn an experimental study, the\ncircumstances\naround the sample is changed. Usually, we compare two groups from a population and these two groups are treated\ndifferently\n.\nOne example can be a medical study to see if a new medicine is effective.\nOne group receives the medicine and the other does not. These are the different circumstances around those samples.\nWe can compare the health of both groups afterwards and see if the results are different.\nExperimental studies can allow us to investigate causal relationships. A well designed experimental study can be useful since it can\nisolate\nthe relationship we are interested in from\nother effects\n. Then we can be more confident that we are measuring the true effect.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
