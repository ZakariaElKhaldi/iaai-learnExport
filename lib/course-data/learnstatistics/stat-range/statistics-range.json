The range of ages for Nobel Prize winners is then 80 years.\nCalculating the Range\nThe range can only be calculated for numerical data.\nFirst, find the smallest and largest values of this example:\n13\n, 21, 21, 40, 48, 55,\n72\nCalculate the difference by subtracting the smallest from the largest:\n72 - 13 =\n59\nCalculating the Range with Programming\nThe range can easily be found with many programming languages.\nUsing software and programming to calculate statistics is more common for bigger sets of data, as finding it manually becomes difficult.\nExample\nWith Python use the NumPy library\nptp()\nmethod to find the range of the values 13, 21, 21, 40, 48, 55, 72:\nimport numpy\nvalues = [13,21,21,40,48,55,72]\nx = numpy.ptp(values)\nprint(x)\n\nExample\nUse the R\nmin()\nand\nmax()\nfunctions to find the range of the values 13, 21, 21, 40, 48, 55, 72:\nvalues <- c(13,21,21,40,48,55,72)\nmax(values) - min(values)\n\nNote:\nThe\nrange()\nfunction in R returns the smallest and largest values.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
