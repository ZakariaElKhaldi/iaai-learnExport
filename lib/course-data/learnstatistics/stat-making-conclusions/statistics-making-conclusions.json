      "content": "Using statistics to make conclusions about a population is called statistical inference.\nStatistical Inference\nStatistics from the data in the\nsample\nis used to make conclusions about the whole\npopulation\n. This is a type of\nstatistical inference\n.\nProbability theory\nis used to calculate the certainty that those statistics also apply to the population.\nWhen using a sample, there will\nalways\nbe some uncertainty about what the data looks like for the population.\nUncertainty is often expressed as\nconfidence intervals\n.\nConfidence intervals are numerical ways of showing how likely it is that the\ntrue value\nof this statistic is within a certain range for the population.\nHypothesis testing\nis a another way of checking if a statement about a population is true. More precisely, it checks how likely it is that a hypothesis is true is based on the sample data.\nSome examples of statements or questions that can be checked with hypothesis testing:\nPeople in the Netherlands taller than people in Denmark\nDo people prefer Pepsi or Coke?\nDoes a new medicine cure a disease?\nNote:\nConfidence intervals and hypothesis testing are closely related and describe the same things in different ways. Both are widely used in science.\nCausal Inference\nCausal inference is used to investigate if something causes another thing.\nFor example: Does rain make plants grow?\nIf we think two things are related we can investigate to see if they\ncorrelate\n. Statistics can be used to find out how strong this relation is.\nEven if things are correlated, finding out of something is caused by other things can be difficult. It can be done with good\nexperimental design\nor other special statistical techniques.\nNote:\nGood experimental design is often difficult to achieve because of ethical concerns or other practical reasons.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
