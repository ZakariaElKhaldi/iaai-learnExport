Averages are measures of the\nlocation\nof the center.\nThere are different types of averages. The most commonly used are:\nMean\nMedian\nMode\nNote:\nIn statistics, averages are often referred to as 'measures of\ncentral tendency\n'.\nFor example, using the values:\n40, 21, 55, 21, 48, 13, 72\nMean\nThe mean is usually referred to as 'the average'.\nThe mean is the sum of all the values in the data divided by the total number of values in the data:\n(40 + 21 + 55 + 31 + 48 + 13 + 72)/7 =\n38.57\nNote:\nThere are are multiple types of mean values. The most common type of mean is the\narithmetic\nmean.\nIn this tutorial, 'mean' refers to the arithmetic mean.\nMedian\nThe\nmedian\nis the 'middle value' of the data.\nThe median is found by\nordering all the values\nin the data and picking the middle value:\n13, 21, 21,\n40\n, 48, 55, 72\nThe median is less influenced by\nextreme\nvalues in the data than the mean.\nChanging the last value to 356 does not change the median:\n13, 21, 21,\n40\n, 48, 55,\n356\nThe median is still 40.\nChanging the last value to 356 changes the\nmean\na lot:\n(13 + 21 + 21 + 40 + 48 + 55 + 72)/7 =\n38.57\n(13 + 21 + 21 + 40 + 48 + 55 +\n356\n)/7 =\n79.14\nNote:\nExtreme values are values in the data that are much smaller or larger than the average values in the data.\nMode\nThe\nmode\nis the value(s) that appears most often in the data:\n40,\n21\n, 55,\n21\n, 48, 13, 72\nHere, 21 appears two times, and the other values only once. The mode of this data is 21.\nThe mode is also used for\ncategorical\ndata, unlike the median and mean. Categorical data can't be described directly with numbers, like names:\nAlice,\nJohn\n, Bob, Maria,\nJohn\n, Julia, Carol\nHere, John appears two times, and the other values only once. The mode of this data is John.\nNote:\nThere can be more than one mode if multiple values appear the same number of times in the data.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
