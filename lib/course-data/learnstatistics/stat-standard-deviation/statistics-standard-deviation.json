      "content": "Standard deviation is the most commonly used measure of variation, which describes how spread out the data is.\nStandard Deviation\nStandard deviation (\u03c3) measures how far a 'typical' observation is from the average of the data (\u03bc).\nStandard deviation is important for many statistical methods.\nHere is a histogram of the age of all 934 Nobel Prize winners up to the year 2020, showing\nstandard deviations\n:\nEach dotted line in the histogram shows a shift of one extra standard deviation.\nIf the data is\nnormally distributed:\nRoughly 68.3% of the data is within 1 standard deviation of the average (from \u03bc-1\u03c3 to \u03bc+1\u03c3)\nRoughly 95.5% of the data is within 2 standard deviations of the average (from \u03bc-2\u03c3 to \u03bc+2\u03c3)\nRoughly 99.7% of the data is within 3 standard deviations of the average (from \u03bc-3\u03c3 to \u03bc+3\u03c3)\nNote:\nA\nnormal\ndistribution has a \"bell\" shape and spreads out equally on both sides.\nCalculating the Standard Deviation\nYou can calculate the standard deviation for both\nthe\npopulation\nand the\nsample\n.\nThe formulas are\nalmost\nthe same and uses different symbols to refer to the standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) and\nsample\nstandard deviation (\\(s\\)).\nCalculating the\nstandard deviation\n(\\(\\sigma\\)) is done with this formula:\n\\(\\displaystyle  \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (x_{i}-\\mu)^2}{n}}\\)\nCalculating the\nsample standard deviation\n(\\(s\\)) is done with this formula:\n\\(\\displaystyle s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (x_{i}-\\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}\\)\n\\(n\\) is the total number of observations.\n\\(\\sum \\) is the symbol for adding together a list of numbers.\n\\(x_{i}\\) is the list of values in the data: \\(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, \\ldots \\)\n\\(\\mu\\) is the population mean and \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean (average value).\n\\( (x_{i} - \\mu ) \\) and \\( (x_{i} - \\bar{x} ) \\) are the differences between the values of the observations (\\(x_{i}\\)) and the mean.\nEach difference is squared and added together.\nThen the sum is divided by \\(n\\) or (\\( n - 1 \\)) and then we find the square root.\nUsing these 4 example values for calculating the\npopulation standard deviation\n:\n4, 11, 7, 14\nWe must first find the\nmean\n:\n\\(\\displaystyle \\mu = \\frac{\\sum x_{i}}{n} = \\frac{4 + 11 + 7 + 14}{4} = \\frac{36}{4} = \\underline{9} \\)\nThen we find the difference between each value and the mean \\( (x_{i}- \\mu)\\):\n\\( 4-9 \\; \\:= -5 \\)\n\\( 11-9 = 2 \\)\n\\( 7-9 \\; \\:= -2 \\)\n\\( 14-9 = 5 \\)\nEach value is then squared, or multiplied with itself \\( ( x_{i}- \\mu )^2\\):\n\\( (-5)^2 = (-5)(-5) = 25 \\)\n\\( 2^2 \\; \\; \\; \\; \\; \\, = 2*2 \\; \\; \\; \\; \\; \\; \\; \\: = 4 \\)\n\\( (-2)^2 = (-2)(-2) = 4 \\)\n\\( 5^2 \\; \\; \\; \\; \\; \\, = 5*5 \\; \\; \\; \\; \\; \\; \\; \\: = 25 \\)\nAll of the squared differences are then added together \\( \\sum (x_{i} -\\mu )^2\\):\n\\( 25 + 4 + 4 + 25 = 58\\)\nThen the sum is divided by the total number of observations, \\( n \\):\n\\( \\displaystyle \\frac{58}{4} = 14.5\\)\nFinally, we take the square root of this number:\n\\( \\sqrt{14.5} \\approx \\underline{3.81} \\)\nSo, the standard deviation of the example values is roughly: \\(3.81 \\)\nCalculating the Standard Deviation with Programming\nThe standard deviation can easily be calculated with many programming languages.\nUsing software and programming to calculate statistics is more common for bigger sets of data, as calculating by hand becomes difficult.\nPopulation Standard Deviation\nExample\nWith Python use the NumPy library\nstd()\nmethod to find the standard deviation of the values 4,11,7,14:\nimport numpy\nvalues = [4,11,7,14]\nx = numpy.std(values)\nprint(x)\n\nExample\nUse an R formula to find the standard deviation of the values 4,11,7,14:\nvalues <- c(4,7,11,14)\nsqrt(mean((values-mean(values))^2))\n\nSample Standard Deviation\nExample\nWith Python use the NumPy library\nstd()\nmethod to find the\nsample\nstandard deviation of the values 4,11,7,14:\nimport numpy\nvalues = [4,11,7,14]\nx = numpy.std(values, ddof=1)\nprint(x)\n\nExample\nUse the R\nsd()\nfunction to find the\nsample\nstandard deviation of the values 4,11,7,14:\nvalues <- c(4,7,11,14)\nsd(values)\n\nStatistics Symbol Reference\nSymbol\nDescription\n\\( \\sigma \\)\nPopulation standard deviation.
