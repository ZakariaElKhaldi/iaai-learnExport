of How to Use the Z-Table\nThe Z-value is found combining the numbers in the first column and the first row.\nFor example, the probability for getting a z-value smaller than 1.85 is found by finding the number in the table where the row is 1.8 and the column is 0.05.\nSo the probability is: 0.9678 is 96.78%.\nz\n.00\n.01\n.02\n.03\n.04\n.05\n.06\n.07\n.08\n.09\n0.0\n0.5000\n0.5040\n0.5080\n0.5120\n0.5160\n0.5199\n0.5239\n0.5279\n0.5319\n0.5359\n0.1\n0.5398\n0.5438\n0.5478\n0.5517\n0.5557\n0.5596\n0.5636\n0.5675\n0.5714\n0.5753\n0.2\n0.5793\n0.5832\n0.5871\n0.5910\n0.5948\n0.5987\n0.6026\n0.6064\n0.6103\n0.6141\n0.3\n0.6179\n0.6217\n0.6255\n0.6293\n0.6331\n0.6368\n0.6406\n0.6443\n0.6480\n0.6517\n0.4\n0.6554\n0.6591\n0.6628\n0.6664\n0.6700\n0.6736\n0.6772\n0.6808\n0.6844\n0.6879\n0.5\n0.6915\n0.6950\n0.6985\n0.7019\n0.7054\n0.7088\n0.7123\n0.7157\n0.7190\n0.7224\n0.6\n0.7257\n0.7291\n0.7324\n0.7357\n0.7389\n0.7422\n0.7454\n0.7486\n0.7517\n0.7549\n0.7\n0.7580\n0.7611\n0.7642\n0.7673\n0.7704\n0.7734\n0.7764\n0.7794\n0.7823\n0.7852\n0.8\n0.7881\n0.7910\n0.7939\n0.7967\n0.7995\n0.8023\n0.8051\n0.8078\n0.8106\n0.8133\n0.9\n0.8159\n0.8186\n0.8212\n0.8238\n0.8264\n0.8289\n0.8315\n0.8340\n0.8365\n0.8389\n1.0\n0.8413\n0.8438\n0.8461\n0.8485\n0.8508\n0.8531\n0.8554\n0.8577\n0.8599\n0.8621\n1.1\n0.8643\n0.8665\n0.8686\n0.8708\n0.8729\n0.8749\n0.8770\n0.8790\n0.8810\n0.8830\n1.2\n0.8849\n0.8869\n0.8888\n0.8907\n0.8925\n0.8944\n0.8962\n0.8980\n0.8997\n0.9015\n1.3\n0.9032\n0.9049\n0.9066\n0.9082\n0.9099\n0.9115\n0.9131\n0.9147\n0.9162\n0.9177\n1.4\n0.9192\n0.9207\n0.9222\n0.9236\n0.9251\n0.9265\n0.9279\n0.9292\n0.9306\n0.9319\n1.5\n0.9332\n0.9345\n0.9357\n0.9370\n0.9382\n0.9394\n0.9406\n0.9418\n0.9429\n0.9441\n1.6\n0.9452\n0.9463\n0.9474\n0.9484\n0.9495\n0.9505\n0.9515\n0.9525\n0.9535\n0.9545\n1.7\n0.9554\n0.9564\n0.9573\n0.9582\n0.9591\n0.9599\n0.9608\n0.9616\n0.9625\n0.9633\n1.8\n0.9641\n0.9649\n0.9656\n0.9664\n0.9671\n0.9678\n0.9686\n0.9693\n0.9699\n0.9706\n1.9\n0.9713\n0.9719\n0.9726\n0.9732\n0.9738\n0.9744\n0.9750\n0.9756\n0.9761\n0.9767\n2.0\n0.9772\n0.9778\n0.9783\n0.9788\n0.9793\n0.9798\n0.9803\n0.9808\n0.9812\n0.9817\n2.1\n0.9821\n0.9826\n0.9830\n0.9834\n0.9838\n0.9842\n0.9846\n0.9850\n0.9854\n0.9857\n2.2\n0.9861\n0.9864\n0.9868\n0.9871\n0.9875\n0.9878\n0.9881\n0.9884\n0.9887\n0.9890\n2.3\n0.9893\n0.9896\n0.9898\n0.9901\n0.9904\n0.9906\n0.9909\n0.9911\n0.9913\n0.9916\n2.4\n0.9918\n0.9920\n0.9922\n0.9925\n0.9927\n0.9929\n0.9931\n0.9932\n0.9934\n0.9936\n2.5\n0.9938\n0.9940\n0.9941\n0.9943\n0.9945\n0.9946\n0.9948\n0.9949\n0.9951\n0.9952\n2.6\n0.9953\n0.9955\n0.9956\n0.9957\n0.9959\n0.9960\n0.9961\n0.9962\n0.9963\n0.9964\n2.7\n0.9965\n0.9966\n0.9967\n0.9968\n0.9969\n0.9970\n0.9971\n0.9972\n0.9973\n0.9974\n2.8\n0.9974\n0.9975\n0.9976\n0.9977\n0.9977\n0.9978\n0.9979\n0.9979\n0.9980\n0.9981\n2.9\n0.9981\n0.9982\n0.9982\n0.9983\n0.9984\n0.9984\n0.9985\n0.9985\n0.9986\n0.9986\n3.0\n0.9987\n0.9987\n0.9987\n0.9988\n0.9988\n0.9989\n0.9989\n0.9989\n0.9990\n0.9990\n3.1\n0.9990\n0.9991\n0.9991\n0.9991\n0.9992\n0.9992\n0.9992\n0.9992\n0.9993\n0.9993\n3.2\n0.9993\n0.9993\n0.9994\n0.9994\n0.9994\n0.9994\n0.9994\n0.9995\n0.9995\n0.9995\n3.3\n0.9995\n0.9995\n0.9995\n0.9996\n0.9996\n0.9996\n0.9996\n0.9996\n0.9996\n0.9997\n3.4\n0.9997\n0.9997\n0.9997\n0.9997\n0.9997\n0.9997\n0.9997\n0.9997\n0.9997\n0.9998\n\n\u2605\n+1",
