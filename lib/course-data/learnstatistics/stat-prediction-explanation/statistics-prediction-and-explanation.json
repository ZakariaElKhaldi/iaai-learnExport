Only the accuracy of prediction is important.\nMany statistical methods are successful at predicting without giving insight into how things are connected.\nSome types of machine learning let computers do the hard work, but the way they predict is difficult to understand. These approaches can also be vulnerable to mistakes if the circumstances change, since the how they work is less clear.\nNote:\nPredictions about future events are called\nforecasts\n. Not all predictions are about the future.\nSome predictions can be about something else that is unknown, even if it is not in the future.\nExplanation\nDifferent statistical methods are often used for explaining how things are connected. These statistical methods may not make good predictions.\nThese statistical methods often explain only small parts of the whole situation. But, if you only want to know how a few things are connected, the rest might not matter.\nIf these methods accurately explains how all the relevant things are connected, they will also be good at prediction. But managing to explain every detail is often challenging.\nSome times we are specifically interested in figuring out if one thing causes another. This is called\ncausal inference\n.\nIf we are looking at complicated situations, many things are connected. To figure out what causes what, we need to untangle every way these things are connected.\nNote:\nMaking conclusions about causality should be done carefully.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
