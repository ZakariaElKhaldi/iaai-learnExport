      "content": "Variation is a measure of how spread out the data is around the \ncenter of the data.\nThe Variation of the Data\nMeasures of variation are statistics of how far away the values in the observations (data points) are from each other.\nThere are different measures of variation. The most commonly used are:\nRange\nQuartiles and Percentiles\nInterquartile Range\nStandard Deviation\nMeasures of variation combined with an average (measure of center) gives a good picture of the distribution of the data.\nNote:\nThese measures of variation can only be calculated for numerical data.\nRange\nThe range is the difference between the smallest and the largest value of the data.\nRange is the simplest measure of variation.\nHere is a histogram of the age of all 934 Nobel Prize winners up to the year 2020, showing the\nrange\n:\nThe youngest winner was 17 years and the oldest was 97 years. The range of ages for Nobel Prize winners is then 80 years.\nQuartiles and Percentiles\nQuartiles and percentiles are ways of separating equal numbers of values in the data into parts.\nQuartiles\nare values that separate the data into four equal parts.\nPercentiles\nare values that separate the data into 100 equal parts.\nHere is a histogram of the age of all 934 Nobel Prize winners up to the year 2020, showing the\nquartiles\n:\nThe quartiles (Q\n0\n,Q\n1\n,Q\n2\n,Q\n3\n,Q\n4\n) are the values that separate each quarter.\nBetween Q\n0\nand Q\n1\nare the 25% lowest values in the data. Between Q\n1\nand Q\n2\nare the \nQ\n0\nis the smallest value in the data.\nQ\n2\nis the middle value (median).\nQ\n4\nis the largest value in the data.\nInterquartile Range\nInterquartile range is the difference between the first and third quartiles (Q\n1\nand Q\n3\n).\nThe 'middle half' of the data is between the first and third quartile.\nHere is a histogram of the age of all 934 Nobel Prize winners up to the year 2020, showing the\ninterquartile range (IQR)\n:\nHere, the middle half of is between 51 and 69 years. The interquartile range for Nobel Prize winners is then 18 years.\nStandard Deviation\nStandard deviation is the most used measure of variation.\nStandard deviation (\u03c3) measures how far a 'typical' observation is from the average of the data (\u03bc).\nStandard deviation is important for many statistical methods.\nHere is a histogram of the age of all 934 Nobel Prize winners up to the year 2020, showing\nstandard deviations\n:\nNote:\nValues within one standard deviation (\u03c3) are considered to be typical.\nValues outside three standard deviations are considered to be\noutliers\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
