But, it can be difficult, or impossible, to make sure that it is completely random.\nNote:\nEvery other sampling method is compared to how close it is to a random sample - the closer, the better.\nConvenience Sampling\nA convenience sample is where the participants that are the easiest to reach are chosen.\nNote:\nConvenience sampling is the easiest to do.\nIn many cases this sample will not be\nsimilar\nenough to the population, and the conclusions can potentially be useless.\nSystematic Sampling\nA systematic sample is where the participants are chosen by some regular system.\nFor example:\nThe first 30 people in a queue\nEvery third on a list\nThe first 10 and the last 10\nStratified Sampling\nA stratified sample is where the population is split into smaller groups called 'strata'.\nThe 'strata' can, for example, be based on demographics, like:\nDifferent age groups\nProfessions\nStratification of a sample is the first step. Another sampling method (like random sampling) is used for the second step of choosing participants from all of the smaller groups (strata).\nClustered Sampling\nA clustered sample is where the population is split into smaller groups called 'clusters'.\nThe clusters are usually natural, like different cities in a country.\nThe clusters are chosen randomly for the sample.\nAll members of the clusters can participate in the sample, or members can be chosen randomly from the clusters in a third step.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
