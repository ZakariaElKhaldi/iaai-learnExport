      "content": "The student's t-distribution is similar to a\nnormal distribution\nand used in statistical inference to adjust for uncertainty.\nStudent's T Distribution\nThe t-distribution is used for estimation and hypothesis testing of a population\nmean\n(average).\nThe t-distribution is adjusted for the extra uncertainty of estimating the mean.\nIf the sample is small, the t-distribution is wider. If the sample is big, the t-distribution is narrower.\nThe bigger the sample size is, the closer the t-distribution gets to the standard normal distribution.\nBelow is a graph of a few different t-distributions.\nNotice how some of the curves have bigger tails.\nThis is due to the uncertainty from a smaller sample size.\nThe green curve has the smallest sample size.\nFor the t-distribution this is expressed as 'degrees of freedom' (df), which is calculated by subtracting 1 from the sample size (n).\nFor example a sample size of 30 will make 29 degrees of freedom for the t-distribution.\nThe t-distribution is used to find\ncritical t-values\nand\np-values\n(probabilities) for estimation and hypothesis testing.\nNote:\nFinding the critical t-values and p-values of the t-distribution is similar z-values and p-values of the standard normal distribution. But make sure to use the correct degrees of freedom.\nFinding the P-Value of a T-Value\nYou can find the p-values of a t-value by using a\nt-table\nor with programming.\nExample\nWith Python use the Scipy Stats library\nt.cdf()\nfunction find the probability of getting less than a t-value of 2.1 with 29 degrees of freedom:\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nprint(stats.t.cdf(2.1, 29))\n\nExample\nWith R use the built-in\npt()\nfunction find the probability of getting less than a t-value of 2.1 with 29 degrees of freedom:\npt(2.1, 29)\n\nFinding the T-value of a P-Value\nYou can find the t-values of a p-value by using a\nt-table\nor with programming.\nExample\nWith Python use the Scipy Stats library\nt.ppf()\nfunction find the t-value separating the top 25% from the bottom 75% with 29 degrees of freedom:\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nprint(stats.t.ppf(0.75, 29))\n\nExample\nWith R use the built-in\nqt()\nfunction find the t-value separating the top 25% from the bottom 75% with 29 degrees of freedom (df):\nqt(0.75, 29)\n\n\u2605\n+1",
