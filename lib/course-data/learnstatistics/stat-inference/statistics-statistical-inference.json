More precisely, it checks how likely it is that a hypothesis is true is based on the sample data.\nThere are different types of hypothesis testing.\nThe steps of the test depends on:\nType of data (categorical or numerical)\nIf you are looking at:\nA single group\nComparing one group to another\nComparing the same group before and after a change\nSome examples of claims or questions that can be checked with hypothesis testing:\n90% of Australians are left handed\nIs the average weight of dogs more than 40kg?\nDo doctors make more money than lawyers?\nProbability Distributions\nStatistical inference methods rely on probability calculation and probability distributions.\nYou will learn about the most important probability distributions in the\n\n\u2605\n+1",
