The interquartile range for Nobel Prize winners is then 18 years.\nCalculating the Interquartile Range with Programming\nThe interquartile range can easily be found with many programming languages.\nUsing software and programming to calculate statistics is more common for bigger sets of data, as finding it manually becomes difficult.\nExample\nWith Python use the SciPy library\niqr()\nmethod to find the interquartile range of the values 13, 21, 21, 40, 42, 48, 55, 72:\nfrom scipy import stats\nvalues = [13,21,21,40,42,48,55,72]\nx = stats.iqr(values)\nprint(x)\n\nExample\nUse the R\nIQR()\nfunction to find the interquartile range of the values 13, 21, 21, 40, 42, 48, 55, 72:\nvalues <- c(13,21,21,40,42,48,55,72)\nIQR(values)\n\n\u2605\n+1",
