      "content": "Descriptive statistics gives us insight into data without having to look at all of it in detail.\nKey Features to Describe about Data\nGetting a quick overview of how the data is distributed is a important step in statistical methods.\nWe calculate key numerical values about the data that tells us about the distribution of the data. We also draw graphs showing visually how the data is distributed.\nKey Features of Data:\nWhere is the center of the data? (location)\nHow much does the data vary? (scale)\nWhat is the shape of the data? (shape)\nThese can be described by\nsummary statistics\n(numerical values).\nThe Center of the Data\nThe\ncenter\nof the data is where most of the values are concentrated.\nDifferent kinds of averages, like mean, median and mode, are\nmeasures\nof the \ncenter.\nNote:\nMeasures of the center are also called\nlocation parameters\n, because they tell us something about where data is 'located' on a number line.\nThe Variation of the Data\nThe\nvariation\nof the data is how spread out the data are around the \ncenter.\nStatistics like standard deviation, range and quartiles are\nmeasures\nof variation.\nNote:\nMeasures of variation are also called\nscale parameters\n.\nThe Shape of the Data\nThe shape of the data can refer to the how the data are bunched up on either side of the \ncenter.\nStatistics like\nskew\ndescribe if the right or left side of the \ncenter is bigger. Skew is one type of\nshape parameters\n.\nFrequency Tables\nOne typical of presenting data is with\nfrequency tables\n.\nA\nfrequency table\ncounts and orders data into a table. Typically, the data will need to be sorted into intervals.\nFrequency tables are often the basis for making graphs to visually present the data.\nVisualizing Data\nDifferent types of graphs are used for different kinds of data. For example:\nPie charts for qualitative data\nHistograms for quantitative data\nScatter plots for bivariate data\nGraphs often have a close connection to numerical summary statistics.\nFor example, box plots show where the\nquartiles\nare.\nQuartiles also tell us where the minimum and maximum values, range, interquartile range, and median are.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
