Frequency is the amount of times that value appeared in the data.\nEach category is represented with a bar. The height of the bar represents the frequency of values from that category in the data.\nHere is a bar graph of the number of people who have won a Nobel Prize in each category up to the year 2020:\nSome of the categories have existed longer than others. Multiple winners are also more common in some categories. So there is a different number of winners in each category.\nNote:\nBar graphs are similar to histograms, which are used for \nquantitative data.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
