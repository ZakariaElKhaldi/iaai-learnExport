That is, the sum of those two values divided by 2:\n\\( \\displaystyle \\frac{40+42}{2} = \\frac{82}{2} = \\underline{41} \\)\nNote:\nIt is important that the numbers are ordered before you can find the median.\nFinding the Median with Programming\nThe median can easily be found with many programming languages.\nUsing software and programming to calculate statistics is more common for bigger sets of data, as finding it manually becomes difficult.\nExample\nWith Python use the NumPy library\nmedian()\nmethod to find the median of the values 13, 21, 21, 40, 42, 48, 55, 72:\nimport numpy\nvalues = [13,21,21,40,42,48,55,72]\nx = numpy.median(values)\nprint(x)\n\nExample\nUse the R\nmedian()\nfunction to find the median of the values 13, 21, 21, 40, 42, 48, 55, 72:\nvalues <- c(13,21,21,40,42,48,55,72)\nmedian(values)\n\n\u2605\n+1",
