      "content": "A population\nmean\nis an average of value a population.\nHypothesis tests are used to check a claim about the size of that population mean.\nHypothesis Testing a Mean\nThe following steps are used for a hypothesis test:\nCheck the conditions\nDefine the claims\nDecide the significance level\nCalculate the test statistic\nConclusion\nFor example:\nPopulation\n: Nobel Prize winners\nCategory\n: Age when they received the prize.\nAnd we want to check the claim:\n\"The average age of Nobel Prize winners when they received the prize is\nmore\nthan 55\"\nBy taking a sample of 30 randomly selected Nobel Prize winners we could find that:\nThe mean age in the sample (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) is 62.1\nThe standard deviation of age in the sample (\\(s\\)) is 13.46\nFrom this sample data we check the claim with the steps below.\n1. Checking the Conditions\nThe conditions for calculating a confidence interval for a proportion are:\nThe sample is\nrandomly selected\nAnd either:\nThe population data is normally distributed\nSample size is large enough\nA moderately large sample size, like 30, is typically large enough.\nIn the example, the sample size was 30 and it was randomly selected, so the conditions are fulfilled.\nNote:\nChecking if the data is normally distributed can be done with specialized statistical tests.\n2. Defining the Claims\nWe need to define a\nnull hypothesis\n(\\(H_{0}\\)) and an\nalternative hypothesis\n(\\(H_{1}\\)) based on the claim we are checking.\nThe claim was:\n\"The average age of Nobel Prize winners when they received the prize is\nmore\nthan 55\"\nIn this case, the\nparameter\nis the mean age of Nobel Prize winners when they received the prize (\\(\\mu\\)).\nThe null and alternative hypothesis are then:\nNull hypothesis\n: The average age was 55.\nAlternative hypothesis\n: The average age was\nmore\nthan 55.\nWhich can be  expressed with symbols as:\n\\(H_{0}\\): \\(\\mu = 55 \\)\n\\(H_{1}\\): \\(\\mu > 55 \\)\nThis is a '\nright\ntailed' test, because the alternative hypothesis claims that the proportion is\nmore\nthan in the null hypothesis.\nIf the data supports the alternative hypothesis, we\nreject\nthe null hypothesis and\naccept\nthe alternative hypothesis.\n3. Deciding the Significance Level\nThe significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) is the\nuncertainty\nwe accept when rejecting the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test.\nThe significance level is a percentage probability of accidentally making the wrong conclusion.\nTypical significance levels are:\n\\(\\alpha = 0.1\\) (10%)\n\\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) (5%)\n\\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) (1%)\nA lower significance level means that the evidence in the data needs to be stronger to reject the null hypothesis.\nThere is no \"correct\" significance level  - it only states the uncertainty of the conclusion.\nNote:\nA 5% significance level means that when we reject a null hypothesis:\nWe expect to reject a\ntrue\nnull hypothesis 5 out of 100 times.\n4. Calculating the Test Statistic\nThe test statistic is used to decide the outcome of the hypothesis test.\nThe test statistic is a\nstandardized\nvalue calculated from the sample.\nThe formula for the test statistic (TS) of a population mean is:\n\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{s} \\cdot \\sqrt{n} \\)\n\\(\\bar{x}-\\mu\\) is the\ndifference\nbetween the\nsample\nmean (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) and the claimed\npopulation\nmean (\\(\\mu\\)).\n\\(s\\) is the\nsample standard deviation\n.\n\\(n\\) is the sample size.\nIn our example:\nThe claimed (\\(H_{0}\\)) population mean (\\(\\mu\\)) was \\( 55 \\)\nThe sample mean (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) was \\(62.1\\)\nThe sample standard deviation (\\(s\\)) was \\(13.46\\)\nThe sample size (\\(n\\)) was \\(30\\)\nSo the test statistic (TS) is then:\n\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{62.1-55}{13.46} \\cdot \\sqrt{30} = \\frac{7.1}{13.46} \\cdot \\sqrt{30}  \\approx 0.528 \\cdot 5.477 = \\underline{2.889}\\)\nYou can also calculate the test statistic using programming language functions:\nExample\nWith Python use the scipy and math libraries to calculate the test statistic.\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nimport math\n# Specify the sample mean (x_bar), the sample standard deviation (s), the mean claimed in the null-hypothesis (mu_null), and the sample size (n)\nx_bar = 62.1\ns = 13.46\nmu_null = 55\nn = 30\n# Calculate and print the test statistic\nprint((x_bar - mu_null)/(s/math.sqrt(n)))\n\nExample\nWith R use built-in math and statistics functions to calculate the test statistic.\n# Specify the sample mean (x_bar), the sample standard deviation (s), the mean claimed in the null-hypothesis (mu_null), and the sample size (n)\nx_bar <- 62.1\ns <- 13.46\nmu_null <- 55\nn <- 30\n# Output the test statistic\n(x_bar - mu_null)/(s/sqrt(n))\n\n5. Concluding\nThere are two main approaches for making the conclusion of a hypothesis test:\nThe\ncritical value\napproach compares the test statistic with the critical value of the significance level.\nThe\nP-value\napproach compares the P-value of the test statistic and with the significance level.\nNote:\nThe two approaches are only different in how they present the conclusion.\nThe Critical Value Approach\nFor the critical value approach we need to find the\ncritical value\n(CV) of the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)).\nFor a population mean test, the critical value (CV) is a\nT-value\nfrom a\nstudent's t-distribution\n.\nThis critical T-value (CV) defines the\nrejection region\nfor the test.\nThe rejection region is an area of probability in the tails of the standard normal distribution.\nBecause the claim is that the population mean is\nmore\nthan 55, the rejection region is in the right tail:\nThe size of the rejection region is decided by the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)).\nThe student's t-distribution is adjusted for the uncertainty from smaller samples.\nThis adjustment is called degrees of freedom (df), which is the sample size \\((n) - 1\\)\nIn this case the degrees of freedom (df) is: \\(30 - 1 = \\underline{29} \\)\nChoosing a significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) of 0.01, or 1%, we can find the critical T-value from a\nT-table\n, or with a programming language function:\nExample\nWith Python use the Scipy Stats library\nt.ppf()\nfunction find the T-Value for an \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.01 at 29 degrees of freedom (df).\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nprint(stats.t.ppf(1-0.01, 29))\n\nExample\nWith R use the built-in\nqt()\nfunction to find the t-value for an \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.01 at 29 degrees of freedom (df).\nqt(1-0.01, 29)\n\nUsing either method we can find that the critical T-Value is \\(\\approx \\underline{2.462}\\)\nFor a\nright\ntailed test we need to check if the test statistic (TS) is\nbigger\nthan the critical value (CV).\nIf the test statistic is bigger than the critical value, the test statistic is in the\nrejection region\n.\nWhen the test statistic is in the rejection region, we\nreject\nthe null hypothesis (\\(H_{0}\\)).\nHere, the test statistic (TS) was \\(\\approx \\underline{2.889}\\) and the critical value was \\(\\approx \\underline{2.462}\\)\nHere is an illustration of this test in a graph:\nSince the test statistic was\nbigger\nthan the critical value we\nreject\nthe null hypothesis.\nThis means that the sample data supports the alternative hypothesis.\nAnd we can summarize the conclusion stating:\nThe sample data\nsupports\nthe claim that \"The average age of Nobel Prize winners when they received the prize is more than 55\" at a\n1% significance level\n.\nThe P-Value Approach\nFor the P-value approach we need to find the\nP-value\nof the test statistic (TS).\nIf the P-value is\nsmaller\nthan the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)), we\nreject\nthe null hypothesis (\\(H_{0}\\)).\nThe test statistic was found to be \\( \\approx \\underline{2.889} \\)\nFor a population proportion test, the test statistic is a T-Value from a\nstudent's t-distribution\n.\nBecause this is a\nright\ntailed test, we need to find the P-value of a t-value\nbigger\nthan 2.889.\nThe student's t-distribution is adjusted according to degrees of freedom (df), which is the sample size \\((30) - 1 = \\underline{29}\\)\nWe can find the P-value using a\nT-table\n, or with a programming language function:\nExample\nWith Python use the Scipy Stats library\nt.cdf()\nfunction find the P-value of a T-value bigger than 2.889 at 29 degrees of freedom (df):\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nprint(1-stats.t.cdf(2.889, 29))\n\nExample\nWith R use the built-in\npt()\nfunction find the P-value of a T-Value bigger than 2.889 at 29 degrees of freedom (df):\n1-pt(2.889, 29)\n\nUsing either method we can find that the P-value is \\(\\approx \\underline{0.0036}\\)\nThis tells us that the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) would need to be bigger than 0.0036, or 0.36%, to\nreject\nthe null hypothesis.\nHere is an illustration of this test in a graph:\nThis P-value is\nsmaller\nthan any of the common significance levels (10%, 5%, 1%).\nSo the null hypothesis is\nrejected\nat all of these significance levels.\nAnd we can summarize the conclusion stating:\nThe sample data\nsupports\nthe claim that \"The average age of Nobel Prize winners when they received the prize is more than 55\" at a\n10%, 5%, or 1% significance level\n.\nNote:\nAn outcome of an hypothesis test that rejects the null hypothesis with a p-value of 0.36% means:\nFor this p-value, we only expect to reject a true null hypothesis 36 out of 10000 times.\nCalculating a P-Value for a Hypothesis Test with Programming\nMany programming languages can calculate the P-value to decide outcome of a hypothesis test.\nUsing software and programming to calculate statistics is more common for bigger sets of data, as calculating manually becomes difficult.\nThe P-value calculated here will tell us the\nlowest possible significance level\nwhere the null-hypothesis can be rejected.\nExample\nWith Python use the scipy and math libraries to calculate the P-value for a right tailed hypothesis test for a mean.\nHere, the sample size is 30, the sample mean is 62.1, the sample standard deviation is 13.46, and the test is for a mean bigger than 55.\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nimport math\n# Specify the sample mean (x_bar), the sample standard deviation (s), the mean claimed in the null-hypothesis (mu_null), and the sample size (n)\nx_bar = 62.1\ns = 13.46\nmu_null = 55\nn = 30\n# Calculate the test statistic\ntest_stat = (x_bar - mu_null)/(s/math.sqrt(n))\n# Output the p-value of the test statistic (right tailed test)\nprint(1-stats.t.cdf(test_stat, n-1))\n\nExample\nWith R use built-in math and statistics functions find the P-value for a right tailed hypothesis test for a mean.\nHere, the sample size is 30, the sample mean is 62.1, the sample standard deviation is 13.46, and the test is for a mean bigger than 55.\n# Specify the sample mean (x_bar), the sample standard deviation (s), the mean claimed in the null-hypothesis (mu_null), and the sample size (n)\nx_bar <- 62.1\ns <- 13.46\nmu_null <- 55\nn <- 30\n# Calculate the test statistic\ntest_stat = (x_bar - mu_null)/(s/sqrt(n))\n# P-value the p-value of the test statistic (right tailed test)\n1-pt(test_stat, n-1)\n\nLeft-Tailed and Two-Tailed Tests\nThis was an example of a\nright\ntailed test, where the alternative hypothesis claimed that parameter is\nbigger\nthan the null hypothesis claim.\nYou can check out an equivalent step-by-step guide for other types here:\nLeft-Tailed Test\nTwo-Tailed Test\n\n\u2605\n+1",
