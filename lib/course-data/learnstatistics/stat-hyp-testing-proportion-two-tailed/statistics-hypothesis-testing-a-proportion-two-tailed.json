      "content": "A population proportion is the share of a population that belongs to a particular\ncategory\n.\nHypothesis tests are used to check a claim about the size of that population proportion.\nHypothesis Testing a Proportion\nThe following steps are used for a hypothesis test:\nCheck the conditions\nDefine the claims\nDecide the significance level\nCalculate the test statistic\nConclusion\nFor example:\nPopulation\n: Nobel Prize winners\nCategory\n: Women\nAnd we want to check the claim:\n\"The share of Nobel Prize winners that are women is\nnot\n50%\"\nBy taking a sample of 100 randomly selected Nobel Prize winners we could find that:\n10 out of 100 Nobel Prize winners in the sample were women\nThe\nsample\nproportion is then: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{10}{100} = 0.1\\), or 10%.\nFrom this sample data we check the claim with the steps below.\n1. Checking the Conditions\nThe conditions for calculating a confidence interval for a proportion are:\nThe sample is\nrandomly selected\nThere is only two options:\nBeing in the category\nNot being in the category\nThe sample needs at least:\n5 members in the category\n5 members not in the category\nIn our example, we randomly selected 10 people that were women.\nThe rest were not women, so there are 90 in the other category.\nThe conditions are fulfilled in this case.\nNote:\nIt is possible to do a hypothesis test without having 5 of each category. But special adjustments need to be made.\n2. Defining the Claims\nWe need to define a\nnull hypothesis\n(\\(H_{0}\\)) and an\nalternative hypothesis\n(\\(H_{1}\\)) based on the claim we are checking.\nThe claim was:\n\"The share of Nobel Prize winners that are women is\nnot\n50%\"\nIn this case, the\nparameter\nis the proportion of Nobel Prize winners that are women (\\(p\\)).\nThe null and alternative hypothesis are then:\nNull hypothesis\n: 50% of Nobel Prize winners were women.\nAlternative hypothesis\n: The share of Nobel Prize winners that are women is\nnot\n50%\nWhich can be  expressed with symbols as:\n\\(H_{0}\\): \\(p = 0.50 \\)\n\\(H_{1}\\): \\(p \\neq 0.50 \\)\nThis is a '\ntwo-tailed\n' test, because the alternative hypothesis claims that the proportion is\ndifferent\n(larger or smaller) than in the null hypothesis.\nIf the data supports the alternative hypothesis, we\nreject\nthe null hypothesis and\naccept\nthe alternative hypothesis.\n3. Deciding the Significance Level\nThe significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) is the\nuncertainty\nwe accept when rejecting the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test.\nThe significance level is a percentage probability of accidentally making the wrong conclusion.\nTypical significance levels are:\n\\(\\alpha = 0.1\\) (10%)\n\\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) (5%)\n\\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) (1%)\nA lower significance level means that the evidence in the data needs to be stronger to reject the null hypothesis.\nThere is no \"correct\" significance level  - it only states the uncertainty of the conclusion.\nNote:\nA 5% significance level means that when we reject a null hypothesis:\nWe expect to reject a\ntrue\nnull hypothesis 5 out of 100 times.\n4. Calculating the Test Statistic\nThe test statistic is used to decide the outcome of the hypothesis test.\nThe test statistic is a\nstandardized\nvalue calculated from the sample.\nThe formula for the test statistic (TS) of a population proportion is:\n\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{\\hat{p} - p}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)}} \\cdot \\sqrt{n} \\)\n\\(\\hat{p}-p\\) is the\ndifference\nbetween the\nsample\nproportion (\\(\\hat{p}\\)) and the claimed\npopulation\nproportion (\\(p\\)).\n\\(n\\) is the sample size.\nIn our example:\nThe claimed (\\(H_{0}\\)) population proportion (\\(p\\)) was \\( 0.50 \\)\nThe sample proportion (\\(\\hat{p}\\)) was 10 out of 100, or: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{10}{100} = 0.10\\)\nThe sample size (\\(n\\)) was \\(100\\)\nSo the test statistic (TS) is then:\n\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{0.1-0.5}{\\sqrt{0.5(1-0.5)}} \\cdot \\sqrt{100} = \\frac{-0.4}{\\sqrt{0.5(0.5)}} \\cdot \\sqrt{100} = \\frac{-0.4}{\\sqrt{0.25}} \\cdot \\sqrt{100} = \\frac{-0.4}{0.5} \\cdot 10 = \\underline{-8}\\)\nYou can also calculate the test statistic using programming language functions:\nExample\nWith Python use the scipy and math libraries to calculate the test statistic for a proportion.\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nimport math\n# Specify the number of occurrences (x), the sample size (n), and the proportion claimed in the null-hypothesis (p)\nx = 10\nn = 100\np = 0.5\n# Calculate the sample proportion\np_hat = x/n\n# Calculate and print the test statistic\nprint((p_hat-p)/(math.sqrt((p*(1-p))/(n))))\n\nExample\nWith R use the built-in math functions to calculate the test statistic for a proportion.\n# Specify the sample occurrences (x), the sample size (n), and the null-hypothesis claim (p)\nx <- 10\nn <- 100\np <- 0.5\n# Calculate the sample proportion\np_hat = x/n\n# Calculate and output the test statistic\n(p_hat-p)/(sqrt((p*(1-p))/(n)))\n\n5. Concluding\nThere are two main approaches for making the conclusion of a hypothesis test:\nThe\ncritical value\napproach compares the test statistic with the critical value of the significance level.\nThe\nP-value\napproach compares the P-value of the test statistic and with the significance level.\nNote:\nThe two approaches are only different in how they present the conclusion.\nThe Critical Value Approach\nFor the critical value approach we need to find the\ncritical value\n(CV) of the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)).\nFor a population proportion test, the critical value (CV) is a\nZ-value\nfrom a\nstandard normal distribution\n.\nThis critical Z-value (CV) defines the\nrejection region\nfor the test.\nThe rejection region is an area of probability in the tails of the standard normal distribution.\nBecause the claim is that the population proportion is\ndifferent\nfrom 50%, the rejection region is split into both the left and right tail:\nThe size of the rejection region is decided by the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)).\nChoosing a significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) of 0.01, or 1%, we can find the critical Z-value from a\nZ-table\n, or with a programming language function:\nNote:\nBecause this is a two-tailed test the tail area (\\(\\alpha\\)) needs to be split in half (divided by 2).\nExample\nWith Python use the Scipy Stats library\nnorm.ppf()\nfunction find the Z-value for an \\(\\alpha\\)/2 = 0.005 in the left tail.\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nprint(stats.norm.ppf(0.005))\n\nExample\nWith R use the built-in\nqnorm()\nfunction to find the Z-value for an \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.005 in the left tail.\nqnorm(0.005)\n\nUsing either method we can find that the critical Z-value in the left tail is \\(\\approx \\underline{-2.5758}\\)\nSince a normal distribution i symmetric, we know that the critical Z-value in the right tail will be the same number, only positive: \\(\\underline{2.5758}\\)\nFor a\ntwo-tailed\ntest we need to check if the test statistic (TS) is\nsmaller\nthan the negative critical value (-CV),\nor bigger\nthan the positive critical value (CV).\nIf the test statistic is smaller than the\nnegative\ncritical value, the test statistic is in the\nrejection region\n.\nIf the test statistic is bigger than the\npositive\ncritical value, the test statistic is in the\nrejection region\n.\nWhen the test statistic is in the rejection region, we\nreject\nthe null hypothesis (\\(H_{0}\\)).\nHere, the test statistic (TS) was \\(\\approx \\underline{-8}\\) and the critical value was \\(\\approx \\underline{-2.5758}\\)\nHere is an illustration of this test in a graph:\nSince the test statistic was\nsmaller\nthan the negative critical value we\nreject\nthe null hypothesis.\nThis means that the sample data supports the alternative hypothesis.\nAnd we can summarize the conclusion stating:\nThe sample data\nsupports\nthe claim that \"The share of Nobel Prize winners that are women is\nnot\n50%\" at a\n1% significance level\n.\nThe P-Value Approach\nFor the P-value approach we need to find the\nP-value\nof the test statistic (TS).\nIf the P-value is\nsmaller\nthan the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)), we\nreject\nthe null hypothesis (\\(H_{0}\\)).\nThe test statistic was found to be \\( \\approx \\underline{-8} \\)\nFor a population proportion test, the test statistic is a Z-Value from a\nstandard normal distribution\n.\nBecause this is a\ntwo-tailed\ntest, we need to find the P-value of a Z-value\nsmaller\nthan -8 and\nmultiply it by 2\n.\nWe can find the P-value using a\nZ-table\n, or with a programming language function:\nExample\nWith Python use the Scipy Stats library\nnorm.cdf()\nfunction find the P-value of a Z-value smaller than -8 for a two tailed test:\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nprint(2*stats.norm.cdf(-8))\n\nExample\nWith R use the built-in\npnorm()\nfunction find the P-value of a Z-value smaller than -8 for a two tailed test:\n2*pnorm(-8)\n\nUsing either method we can find that the P-value is \\(\\approx \\underline{1.25 \\cdot 10^{-15}}\\) or \\(0.00000000000000125\\)\nThis tells us that the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) would need to be bigger than 0.000000000000125%, to\nreject\nthe null hypothesis.\nHere is an illustration of this test in a graph:\nThis P-value is\nsmaller\nthan any of the common significance levels (10%, 5%, 1%).\nSo the null hypothesis is\nrejected\nat all of these significance levels.\nAnd we can summarize the conclusion stating:\nThe sample data\nsupports\nthe claim that \"The share of Nobel Prize winners that are women is not 50%\" at a\n10%, 5%, and 1% significance level\n.\nCalculating a P-Value for a Hypothesis Test with Programming\nMany programming languages can calculate the P-value to decide outcome of a hypothesis test.\nUsing software and programming to calculate statistics is more common for bigger sets of data, as calculating manually becomes difficult.\nThe P-value calculated here will tell us the\nlowest possible significance level\nwhere the null-hypothesis can be rejected.\nExample\nWith Python use the scipy and math libraries to calculate the P-value for a two-tailed tailed hypothesis test for a proportion.\nHere, the sample size is 100, the occurrences are 10, and the test is for a proportion different from than 0.50.\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nimport math\n# Specify the number of occurrences (x), the sample size (n), and the proportion claimed in the null-hypothesis (p)\nx = 10\nn = 100\np = 0.5\n# Calculate the sample proportion\np_hat = x/n\n# Calculate the test statistic\ntest_stat = (p_hat-p)/(math.sqrt((p*(1-p))/(n)))\n# Output the p-value of the test statistic (two-tailed test)\nprint(2*stats.norm.cdf(test_stat))\n\nExample\nWith R use the built-in\nprop.test()\nfunction find the P-value for a left tailed hypothesis test for a proportion.\nHere, the sample size is 100, the occurrences are 10, and the test is for a proportion different from 0.50.\n# Specify the sample occurrences (x), the sample size (n), and the null-hypothesis claim (p)\nx <- 10\nn <- 100\np <- 0.5\n# P-value from left-tail proportion test at 0.01 significance level\nprop.test(x, n, p, alternative = c(\"two.sided\"), conf.level = 0.99, correct = FALSE)$p.value\n\nNote:\nThe\nconf.level\nin the R code is the reverse of the significance level.\nHere, the significance level is 0.01, or 1%, so the conf.level is 1-0.01 = 0.99, or 99%.\nLeft-Tailed and Two-Tailed Tests\nThis was an example of a\ntwo\ntailed test, where the alternative hypothesis claimed that parameter is\ndifferent\nfrom the null hypothesis claim.\nYou can check out an equivalent step-by-step guide for other types
