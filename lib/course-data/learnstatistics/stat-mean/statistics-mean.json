      "content": "The mean is a type of average value, which describes where center of the data is located.\nMean\nThe mean is usually referred to as 'the average'.\nThe mean is the sum of all the values in the data divided by the total number of values in the data.\nThe mean is calculated for numerical variables. A variable is something in the data that can vary, like:\nAge\nHeight\nIncome\nNote:\nThere are are multiple types of mean values. The most common type of mean is the\narithmetic\nmean.\nIn this tutorial 'mean' refers to the arithmetic mean.\nCalculating the Mean\nYou can calculate the mean for both\nthe\npopulation\nand the\nsample\n.\nThe formulas are the same and uses different symbols to refer to the population mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and sample mean (\\(\\bar{x}\\)).\nCalculating the\npopulation mean\n(\\(\\mu\\)) is done with this formula:\n\\(\\displaystyle  \\mu = \\frac{\\sum x_{i}}{n}\\)\nCalculating the\nsample mean\n(\\(\\bar{x}\\)) is done with this formula:\n\\(\\displaystyle \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x_{i}}{n}\\)\nThe bottom part of the fraction (\\(n\\)) is the total number of observations.\n\\(\\sum \\) is the symbol for adding together a list of numbers.\n\\(x_{i}\\) is the list of values in the data: \\(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, \\ldots \\)\nThe top part of the fraction (\\(\\sum x_{i}\\)) is the sum of \\(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, \\ldots \\) added together.\nSo, if a sample has 4 observations with values: 4, 11, 7, 14 the calculation is:\n\\(\\displaystyle \\bar{x} = \\frac{4 + 11 + 7 + 14}{4} = \\frac{36}{4} = \\underline{9} \\)\nCalculation with Programming\nThe mean can easily be calculated with many programming languages.\nUsing software and programming to calculate statistics is more common for bigger sets of data, as calculating by hand becomes difficult.\nExample\nWith Python use the NumPy library\nmean()\nmethod to find the mean of the values 4,11,7,14:\nimport numpy\nvalues = [4,11,7,14]\nx = numpy.mean(values)\nprint(x)\n\nExample\nUse the R\nmean()\nfunction to find the mean of the values 4,11,7,14:\nvalues <- c(4,7,11,14)\nmean(values)\n\nStatistics Symbol Reference\nSymbol\nDescription\n\\( \\mu \\)\nThe population mean. Pronounced 'mu'.\n\\( \\bar{x} \\)\nThe sample mean. Pronounced 'x-bar'.\n\\( \\sum \\)\nThe summation operator, 'capital sigma'.\n\\( x \\)\nThe variable 'x' we are calculating the average for.\n\\( i \\)\nThe index 'i' of the variable 'x'. This identifies each observation for a variable.\n\\( n \\)\nThe number of observations.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
