Between Q\n1\nand Q\n2\nare the \nQ\n0\nis the smallest value in the data.\nQ\n1\nis the value separating the first quarter from the second quarter of the data.\nQ\n2\nis the middle value (median), separating the bottom from the top half.\nQ\n3\nis the value separating the third quarter from the fourth quarter\nQ\n4\nis the largest value in the data.\nCalculating Quartiles with Programming\nQuartiles can easily be found with many programming languages.\nUsing software and programming to calculate statistics is more common for bigger sets of data, as finding it manually becomes difficult.\nExample\nWith Python use the NumPy library\nquantile()\nmethod to find the quartiles of the values 13, 21, 21, 40, 42, 48, 55, 72:\nimport numpy\nvalues = [13,21,21,40,42,48,55,72]\nx = numpy.quantile(values, [0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1])\nprint(x)\n\nExample\nUse the R\nquantile()\nfunction to find the quantiles of the values 13, 21, 21, 40, 42, 48, 55, 72:\nvalues <- c(13,21,21,40,42,48,55,72)\nquantile(values)\n\nPercentiles\nPercentiles\nare values that separate the data into 100 equal parts.\nFor example, The 95th percentile separates the lowest 95% of the values from the top 5%\nThe 25th percentile (P\n25%\n) is the same as the first quartile (Q\n1\n).\nThe 50th percentile (P\n50%\n) is the same as the second quartile (Q\n2\n) and the median.\nThe 75th percentile (P\n75%\n) is the same as the third quartile (Q\n3\n)\nCalculating Percentiles with Programming\nPercentiles can easily be found with many programming languages.\nUsing software and programming to calculate statistics is more common for bigger sets of data, as finding it manually becomes difficult.\nExample\nWith Python use the NumPy library\npercentile()\nmethod to find the\n65\nth percentile of the values 13, 21, 21, 40, 42, 48, 55, 72:\nimport numpy\nvalues = [13,21,21,40,42,48,55,72]\nx = numpy.percentile(values, 65)\nprint(x)\n\nExample\nUse the R\nquantile()\nfunction to find the 65th percentile (\n0.65\n) of the values 13, 21, 21, 40, 42, 48, 55, 72:\nvalues <- c(13,21,21,40,42,48,55,72)\nquantile(values, 0.65)\n\n\u2605\n+1",
