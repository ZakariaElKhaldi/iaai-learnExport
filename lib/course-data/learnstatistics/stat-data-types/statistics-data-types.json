For example, the proportion of Indian people in the world, or the percent of people who prefer one brand to another.\nQuantitative Data\nInformation about something that is described by numbers.\nExamples:\nIncome\nAge\nHeight\nWith numerical data we can calculate statistics like the\naverage\nincome in a country, or the\nrange\nof heights of players in a football team.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
