      "content": "A population proportion is the share of a population that belongs to a particular\ncategory\n.\nConfidence intervals are used to\nestimate\npopulation proportions.\nEstimating Population Proportions\nA statistic from a\nsample\nis used to estimate a parameter of the population.\nThe most likely value for a parameter is the\npoint estimate\n.\nAdditionally, we can calculate a\nlower bound\nand an\nupper bound\nfor the estimated parameter.\nThe\nmargin of error\nis the difference between the lower and upper bounds from the point estimate.\nTogether, the lower and upper bounds define a\nconfidence interval\n.\nCalculating a Confidence Interval\nThe following steps are used to calculate a confidence interval:\nCheck the conditions\nFind the point estimate\nDecide the confidence level\nCalculate the margin of error\nCalculate the confidence interval\nFor example:\nPopulation\n: Nobel Prize winners\nCategory\n: Born in the United States of America\nWe can take a sample and see how many of them were born in the US.\nThe sample data is used to make an estimation of the share of\nall\nthe Nobel Prize winners born in the US.\nBy randomly selecting 30 Nobel Prize winners we could find that:\n6 out of 30 Nobel Prize winners in the sample were born in the US\nFrom this data we can calculate a confidence interval with the steps below.\n1. Checking the Conditions\nThe conditions for calculating a confidence interval for a proportion are:\nThe sample is\nrandomly selected\nThere is only two options:\nBeing in the category\nNot being in the category\nThe sample needs at least:\n5 members in the category\n5 members not in the category\nIn our example, we randomly selected 6 people that were born in the US.\nThe rest were not born in the US, so there are 24 in the other category.\nThe conditions are fulfilled in this case.\nNote:\nIt is possible to calculate a confidence interval without having 5 of each category. But special adjustments need to be made.\n2. Finding the Point Estimate\nThe point estimate is the sample proportion (\\(\\hat{p}\\)).\nThe formula for calculating the sample proportion is the number of \noccurrences (\\(x\\)) divided by the sample size (\\(n\\)):\n\\(\\displaystyle \\hat{p} =\\frac{x}{n}\\)\nIn our example, 6 out of 30 were born in the US: \\(x\\) is 6, and \\(n\\) is 30.\nSo the point estimate for the proportion is:\n\\(\\displaystyle \\hat{p} = \\frac{x}{n} = \\frac{6}{30} = \\underline{0.2} = 20\\%\\)\nSo 20% of the sample were born in the US.\n3. Deciding the Confidence Level\nThe confidence level is expressed with a percentage or a decimal number.\nFor example, if the confidence level is 95% or 0.95:\nThe remaining probability (\\(\\alpha\\)) is then: 5%, or 1 - 0.95 = 0.05.\nCommonly used confidence levels are:\n90% with \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.1\n95% with \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05\n99% with \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.01\nNote:\nA 95% confidence level means that if we take 100 different samples and make confidence intervals for each:\nThe true parameter will be inside the confidence interval 95 out of those 100 times.\nWe use the\nstandard normal distribution\nto find the\nmargin of error\nfor the confidence interval.\nThe remaining probabilities (\\(\\alpha\\)) are divided in two so that half is in each tail area of the distribution.\nThe values on the z-value axis that separate the tails area from the middle are called\ncritical z-values\n.\nBelow are graphs of the standard normal distribution showing the tail areas (\\(\\alpha\\)) for different confidence levels.\n4. Calculating the Margin of Error\nThe margin of error is the difference between the point estimate and the lower and upper bounds.\nThe margin of error (\\(E\\)) for a proportion is calculated with a\ncritical z-value\nand the\nstandard error\n:\n\\(\\displaystyle E = Z_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} \\)\nThe critical z-value \\(Z_{\\alpha/2} \\) is calculated from the standard normal distribution and the confidence level.\nThe standard error \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} \\) is calculated from the point estimate (\\(\\hat{p}\\)) and sample size (\\(n\\)).\nIn our example with 6 US-born Nobel Prize winners out of a sample of 30 the standard error is:\n\\(\\displaystyle \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.2(1-0.2)}{30}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.2 \\cdot 0.8}{30}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.16}{30}} = \\sqrt{0.00533..} \\approx \\underline{0.073}\\)\nIf we choose 95% as the confidence level, the \\(\\alpha\\) is 0.05.\nSo we need to find the critical z-value \\(Z_{0.05/2} = Z_{0.025}\\)\nThe critical z-value can be found using a\nZ-table\nor with a programming language function:\nExample\nWith Python use the Scipy Stats library\nnorm.ppf()\nfunction find the Z-value for an \\(\\alpha\\)/2 = 0.025\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nprint(stats.norm.ppf(1-0.025))\n\nExample\nWith R use the built-in\nqnorm()\nfunction to find the Z-value for an \\(\\alpha\\)/2 = 0.025\nqnorm(1-0.025)\n\nUsing either method we can find that the critical Z-value \\( Z_{\\alpha/2} \\) is \\(\\approx \\underline{1.96} \\)\nThe standard error \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\\) was \\( \\approx \\underline{0.073}\\)\nSo the margin of error (\\(E\\)) is:\n\\(\\displaystyle E = Z_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} \\approx 1.96 \\cdot 0.073  = \\underline{0.143}\\)\n5. Calculate the Confidence Interval\nThe lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval are found by subtracting and adding the margin of error (\\(E\\)) from the point estimate (\\(\\hat{p}\\)).\nIn our example the point estimate was 0.2 and the margin of error was 0.143, then:\nThe lower bound is:\n\\(\\hat{p} - E = 0.2 - 0.143 = \\underline{0.057} \\)\nThe upper bound is:\n\\(\\hat{p} + E = 0.2 + 0.143 = \\underline{0.343} \\)\nThe confidence interval is:\n\\([0.057, 0.343]\\) or \\([5.7 \\%, 34.4 \\%]\\)\nAnd we can summarize the confidence interval by stating:\nThe\n95%\nconfidence interval for the proportion of Nobel Prize winners born in the US is between\n5.7% and 34.4%\nCalculating a Confidence Interval with Programming\nA confidence interval can be calculated with many programming languages.\nUsing software and programming to calculate statistics is more common for bigger sets of data, as calculating manually becomes difficult.\nExample\nWith Python, use the scipy and math libraries to calculate the confidence interval for an estimated proportion.\nHere, the sample size is 30 and the occurrences is 6.\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nimport math\n# Specify sample occurrences (x), sample size (n) and confidence level\nx = 6\nn = 30\nconfidence_level = 0.95\n# Calculate the point estimate, alpha, the critical z-value, the \n    standard error, and the margin of error\npoint_estimate = x/n\nalpha = (1-confidence_level)\ncritical_z = stats.norm.ppf(1-alpha/2)\nstandard_error = math.sqrt((point_estimate*(1-point_estimate)/n))\nmargin_of_error = critical_z * standard_error\n# Calculate the lower and upper bound of the confidence interval\nlower_bound = point_estimate - margin_of_error\nupper_bound = point_estimate + margin_of_error\n# Print the results\nprint(\"Point Estimate: {:.3f}\".format(point_estimate))\nprint(\"Critical Z-value: {:.3f}\".format(critical_z))\nprint(\"Margin of Error: {:.3f}\".format(margin_of_error))\nprint(\"Confidence Interval: [{:.3f},{:.3f}]\".format(lower_bound,upper_bound))\nprint(\"The {:.1%} confidence interval for the population proportion is:\".format(confidence_level))\nprint(\"between {:.3f} and {:.3f}\".format(lower_bound,upper_bound))\n\nExample\nWith R, use the built-in math and statistics functions to calculate the confidence interval for an estimated proportion.\nHere, the sample size is 30 and the occurrences is 6.\n# Specify sample occurrences (x), sample size (n) and confidence level\nx = 6\nn = 30\nconfidence_level = 0.95\n# Calculate the point estimate, alpha, the critical z-value, the standard error, and the margin of error\npoint_estimate = x/n\nalpha = (1-confidence_level)\ncritical_z = qnorm(1-alpha/2)\nstandard_error = sqrt(point_estimate*(1-point_estimate)/n)\nmargin_of_error = critical_z * standard_error\n# Calculate the lower and upper bound of the confidence interval\nlower_bound = point_estimate - margin_of_error\nupper_bound = point_estimate + margin_of_error\n# Print the results\nsprintf(\"Point Estimate: %0.3f\", point_estimate)\nsprintf(\"Critical Z-value: %0.3f\", critical_z)\nsprintf(\"Margin of Error: %0.3f\", margin_of_error)\nsprintf(\"Confidence Interval: [%0.3f,%0.3f]\", lower_bound, upper_bound)\nsprintf(\"The %0.1f%% confidence interval for the population proportion is:\", confidence_level*100)\nsprintf(\"between %0.4f and %0.4f\", lower_bound, upper_bound)\n\n\u2605\n+1",
