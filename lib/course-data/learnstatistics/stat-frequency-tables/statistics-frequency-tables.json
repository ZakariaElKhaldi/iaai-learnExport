      "content": "A frequency table is a way to present data. The data are counted and ordered to summarize larger sets of data.\nWith a frequency table you can analyze the way the data is distributed across different values.\nFrequency Tables\nFrequency means the number of times a value appears in the data. A table can quickly show us how many times each value appears.\nIf the data has many different values, it is easier to use intervals of values to present them in a table.\nHere is the age of the 934 Nobel Prize winners up until the year 2020. In the table each row is an age interval of 10 years.\nAge Interval\nFrequency\n10-19\n1\n20-29\n2\n30-39\n48\n40-49\n158\n50-59\n236\n60-69\n262\n70-79\n174\n80-89\n50\n90-99\n3\nWe can see that there is only one winner from ages 10 to 19. And that the highest number of winners are in their 60s.\nNote:\nThe intervals for the values are also called 'bins'.\nRelative Frequency Tables\nRelative frequency means the number of times a value appears in the data compared to the total amount. A\npercentage\nis a relative frequency.\nHere are the relative frequencies of ages of Noble Prize winners. Now, all the frequencies are divided by the total (934) to give percentages.\nAge Interval\nRelative Frequency\n10-19\n0.11%\n20-29\n0.21%\n30-39\n5.14%\n40-49\n16.92%\n50-59\n25.27%\n60-69\n28.05%\n70-79\n18.63%\n80-89\n5.35%\n90-99\n0.32%\nCumulative Frequency Tables\nCumulative frequency counts up to a particular value.\nHere are the cumulative frequencies of ages of Nobel Prize winners. Now, we can see how many winners have been younger than a certain age.\nAge\nCumulative Frequency\nYounger than 20\n1\nYounger than 30\n3\nYounger than 40\n51\nYounger than 50\n209\nYounger than 60\n445\nYounger than 70\n707\nYounger than 80\n881\nYounger than 90\n931\nYounger than 100\n934\nCumulative frequency tables can also be made with relative frequencies (percentages).\n\n\u2605\n+1",
