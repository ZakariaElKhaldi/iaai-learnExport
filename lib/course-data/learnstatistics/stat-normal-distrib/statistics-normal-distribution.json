      "content": "The normal distribution is an important probability distribution used in \nstatistics.\nMany real world examples of data are normally distributed.\nNormal Distribution\nThe normal distribution is described by the\nmean\n(\\(\\mu\\)) and the\nstandard deviation\n(\\(\\sigma\\)).\nThe normal distribution is often referred to as a 'bell curve' because of it's shape:\nMost of the values are around the center (\\(\\mu\\))\nThe\nmedian\nand mean are equal\nIt has only one\nmode\nIt is symmetric, meaning it decreases the same amount on the left and the right of the \n  center\nThe area under the curve of the normal distribution represents probabilities for the data.\nThe area under the whole curve is equal to 1, or 100%\nHere is a graph of a normal distribution with probabilities between standard deviations (\\(\\sigma\\)):\nRoughly 68.3% of the data is within 1 standard deviation of the average (from \u03bc-1\u03c3 to \u03bc+1\u03c3)\nRoughly 95.5% of the data is within 2 standard deviations of the average (from \u03bc-2\u03c3 to \u03bc+2\u03c3)\nRoughly 99.7% of the data is within 3 standard deviations of the average (from \u03bc-3\u03c3 to \u03bc+3\u03c3)\nNote:\nProbabilities of the normal distribution can only be calculated for intervals (between two values).\nDifferent Mean and Standard Deviations\nThe mean describes where the center of the normal distribution is.\nHere is a graph showing three different normal distributions with the\nsame\nstandard deviation but different means.\nThe standard deviation describes how spread out the normal distribution is.\nHere is a graph showing three different normal distributions with the\nsame\nmean but different standard deviations.\nThe purple curve has the biggest standard deviation and the black curve has the smallest standard deviation.\nThe area under each of the curves is still 1, or 100%.\nA Real Data Example of Normally Distributed Data\nReal world data is often normally distributed.\nHere is a histogram of the age of Nobel Prize winners when they won the prize:\nThe normal distribution drawn on top of the histogram is based on the population mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of the real data.\nWe can see that the histogram close to a normal distribution.\nExamples of real world variables that can be normally distributed:\nTest scores\nHeight\nBirth weight\nProbability Distributions\nProbability distributions are functions that calculates the probabilities of the outcomes of random variables.\nTypical examples of random variables are coin tosses and dice rolls.\nHere is an graph showing the results of a growing number of coin tosses and the expected values of the results (heads or tails).\nThe expected values of the coin toss is the probability distribution of the coin toss.\nNotice how the result of random coin tosses gets closer to the expected values (50%) as the number of tosses increases.\nSimilarly, here is a graph showing the results of a growing number of dice rolls and the expected values of the results (from 1 to 6).\nNotice again how the result of random dice rolls gets closer to the expected values (1/6, or 16.666%) as the number of rolls increases.\nWhen the random variable is a\nsum\nof dice rolls the results and expected values take a different shape.\nThe different shape comes from there being more ways of getting a sum of near the middle, than a small or large sum.\nAs we keep increasing the number of dice for a sum the shape of the results and expected values look more and more like a normal distribution.\nMany real world variables follow a similar pattern and naturally form normal distributions.\nNormally distributed variables can be analyzed with well-known techniques.\nYou will learn about some of the most common and useful techniques in the following pages.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
