If they are similar enough, we say that the sample is\nrepresentative\nof the population.\nThe sample is used to make conclusions about the whole population. If the sample is not similar enough to the whole population, the conclusions could be useless.\nNote:\nMany words have specific meanings in statistics.\nThe word 'population' normally refers to a group of people. In statistics, it is any specific group that we are interested in learning about.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
