It is often much easier to collect a smaller group of that population and analyze that. This is called a\nsample\n.\nA representative sample\nThe sample needs to be\nsimilar\nto the whole population of France. It should have the same characteristics as the population. If you only include people named Jacques living in Paris who are 48 years old, the sample will not be similar to the whole population.\nSo for a good sample, you will need people from all over France, with different ages, professions, and so on.\nIf the members of the sample have similar characteristics (like age, profession, etc.) to the whole population of France, we say that the sample is\nrepresentative\nof the population.\nA good\nrepresentative sample\nis crucial for statistical methods.\nNote:\nData from a proper sample is often just as good data from the whole population, as long as it is\nrepresentative!\nA good sample allows you to make accurate conclusions about the whole population.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
