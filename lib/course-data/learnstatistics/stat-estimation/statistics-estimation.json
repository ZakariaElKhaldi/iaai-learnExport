      "content": "Point estimates are the most likely value for a\npopulation parameter\n.\nConfidence intervals express the uncertainty of an estimated population parameter.\nThe Point Estimate\nA point estimate is calculated from a\nsample\n.\nThe point estimate depends on the type of data:\nCategorical data\n: the number of occurrences divided by the sample size.\nNumerical data\n: the\nmean\n(the average) of the sample.\nOne example could be:\nThe point estimate for the average height of people in Denmark is 180 cm.\nEstimates are always\nuncertain\n. This uncertainty can be expressed with a\nconfidence interval\n.\nConfidence Intervals\nThe confidence interval is defined by a\nlower bound\nand an\nupper bound\n.\nThis gives us a range of values that the true parameter is likely to be between.\nFor example that:\nThe average height of people in Denmark is between 170 cm and 190 cm.\nHere, 170 cm is the lower bound, and 190 cm is the upper bound.\nThe lower and upper bounds of a confidence interval is based on the\nconfidence level\n.\nThe Confidence Level\nConfidence levels can be expressed as percentages or decimal numbers, and the most commonly used are:\n90% (0.90)\n95% (0.95)\n99% (0.99)\nThe higher the confidence level, the bigger the interval will be.\nFor example, the confidence intervals for the average height of people in Denmark might be:\n90% confidence level: between 175 cm and 185 cm.\n95% confidence level: between 170 cm and 190 cm.\n99% confidence level: between 160 cm and 200 cm.\nWe use this confidence level together with a probability distribution to decide how large the\nmargin of error\nis.\nThe Margin of Error\nThe margin of error is the distance between the point estimate and the lower and upper bounds.\nThe margin of error is based on the confidence level and the data we have from the sample.\nFor example, if the point estimate for the average height of people in \nDenmark is 180 cm:\n5 cm margin of error: between 175 cm and 185 cm.\n10 cm margin of error: between 170 cm and 190 cm.\n20 cm margin of error: between 160 cm and 200 cm.\nSteps for Calculating the Confidence Interval\nThe following steps are used to calculate a confidence interval:\nCheck the conditions\nFind the point estimate\nDecide the confidence level\nCalculate the margin of error\nCalculate the confidence interval\nOne\ncondition\nis that the sample is\nrandomly selected\nfrom the population.\nThe other conditions depends on what type of parameter you are calculate the confidence interval for.\nCommonly  estimated parameters are:\nProportions (for qualitative data)\nMean values (for numerical data)\nYou will learn the steps for both types in the following pages.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
