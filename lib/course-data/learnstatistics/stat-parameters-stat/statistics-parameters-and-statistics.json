The parameters are usually unknown.\nSample statistics gives us\nestimates\nfor parameters.\nThere will always be some\nuncertainty\nabout how accurate estimates are. More certainty gives us more useful knowledge.\nFor every parameter we want to learn about we can get a sample and calculate a sample statistic, which gives us an estimate of the parameter.\nSome Important Examples\nParameter\nSample statistic\nMean\nSample mean\nMedian\nSample median\nMode\nSample mode\nVariance\nSample variance\nStandard deviation\nSample standard deviation\nMean, median and mode\nare different types of averages (typical values in a population).\nFor example:\nThe typical age of people in a country\nThe typical profits of a company\nThe typical range of an electric car\nVariance\nand\nstandard deviation\nare two types of values describing how spread out the values are.\nA single class of students in a school would usually be about the same age. The age of the students will have\nlow\nvariance and standard deviation.\nA whole country will have people of all kinds of different ages. The variance and standard deviation of age in the whole country would then be\nbigger\nthan in a single school grade.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
