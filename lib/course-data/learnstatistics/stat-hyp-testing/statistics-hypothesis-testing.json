      "content": "Hypothesis testing is a formal way of checking if a hypothesis about a\npopulation\nis true or not.\nHypothesis Testing\nA\nhypothesis\nis a claim about a population\nparameter\n.\nA\nhypothesis test\nis a formal procedure to check if a hypothesis is true or not.\nExamples of claims that can be checked:\nThe average height of people in Denmark is\nmore\nthan 170 cm.\nThe share of left handed people in Australia is\nnot\n10%.\nThe average income of dentists is\nless\nthe average income of lawyers.\nThe Null and Alternative Hypothesis\nHypothesis testing is based on making two different claims about a population parameter.\nThe\nnull\nhypothesis (\\(H_{0} \\)) and the\nalternative\nhypothesis (\\(H_{1}\\)) are the claims.\nThe two claims needs to be\nmutually exclusive\n, meaning only one of them can be true.\nThe alternative hypothesis is typically what we are trying to prove.\nFor example, we want to check the following claim:\n\"The average height of people in Denmark is more than 170 cm.\"\nIn this case, the\nparameter\nis the average height of people in Denmark (\\(\\mu\\)).\nThe null and alternative hypothesis would be:\nNull hypothesis\n: The average height of people in Denmark\nis\n170 cm.\nAlternative hypothesis\n: The average height of people in Denmark is\nmore\nthan 170 cm.\nThe claims are often expressed with symbols like this:\n\\(H_{0}\\): \\(\\mu = 170 \\: cm \\)\n\\(H_{1}\\): \\(\\mu > 170 \\: cm \\)\nIf the data supports the alternative hypothesis, we\nreject\nthe null hypothesis and\naccept\nthe alternative hypothesis.\nIf the data does\nnot\nsupport the alternative hypothesis, we\nkeep\nthe null hypothesis.\nNote:\nThe alternative hypothesis is also referred to as (\\(H_{A} \\)).\nThe Significance Level\nThe significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) is the\nuncertainty\nwe accept when rejecting the null hypothesis in the hypothesis test.\nThe significance level is a percentage probability of accidentally making the wrong conclusion.\nTypical significance levels are:\n\\(\\alpha = 0.1\\) (10%)\n\\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) (5%)\n\\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) (1%)\nA lower significance level means that the evidence in the data needs to be stronger to reject the null hypothesis.\nThere is no \"correct\" significance level  - it only states the uncertainty of the conclusion.\nNote:\nA 5% significance level means that when we reject a null hypothesis:\nWe expect to reject a\ntrue\nnull hypothesis 5 out of 100 times.\nThe Test Statistic\nThe test statistic is used to decide the outcome of the hypothesis test.\nThe test statistic is a\nstandardized\nvalue calculated from the sample.\nStandardization means converting a statistic to a well known\nprobability distribution\n.\nThe type of probability distribution depends on the type of test.\nCommon examples are:\nStandard Normal Distribution\n(Z): used for\nTesting Population Proportions\nStudent's T-Distribution\n(T): used for\nTesting Population Means\nNote:\nYou will learn how to calculate the test statistic for each type of test in the following chapters.\nThe Critical Value and P-Value Approach\nThere are two main approaches used for hypothesis tests:\nThe\ncritical value\napproach compares the test statistic with the critical value of the significance level.\nThe\np-value\napproach compares the p-value of the test statistic and with the significance level.\nThe Critical Value Approach\nThe critical value approach checks if the test statistic is in the\nrejection region\n.\nThe rejection region is an area of probability in the tails of the distribution.\nThe size of the rejection region is decided by the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)).\nThe value that separates the rejection region from the rest is called the\ncritical value\n.\nHere is a graphical illustration:\nIf the test statistic is\ninside\nthis rejection region, the null hypothesis is\nrejected\n.\nFor example, if the test statistic is 2.3 and the critical value is 2 for a significance level (\\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)):\nWe reject the null hypothesis (\\(H_{0} \\)) at 0.05 significance level (\\(\\alpha\\))\nThe P-Value Approach\nThe p-value approach checks if the p-value of the test statistic is\nsmaller\nthan the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)).\nThe p-value of the test statistic is the area of probability in the tails of the distribution from the value of the test statistic.\nHere is a graphical illustration:\nIf the p-value is\nsmaller\nthan the significance level, the null hypothesis is\nrejected\n.\nThe p-value directly tells us the\nlowest significance level\nwhere we can reject the null hypothesis.\nFor example, if the p-value is 0.03:\nWe reject the null hypothesis (\\(H_{0} \\)) at a 0.05 significance level (\\(\\alpha\\))\nWe keep the null hypothesis (\\(H_{0}\\)) at a 0.01 significance level (\\(\\alpha\\))\nNote:\nThe two approaches are only different in how they present the conclusion.\nSteps for a Hypothesis Test\nThe following steps are used for a hypothesis test:\nCheck the conditions\nDefine the claims\nDecide the significance level\nCalculate the test statistic\nConclusion\nOne\ncondition\nis that the sample is\nrandomly selected\nfrom the population.\nThe other conditions depends on what type of parameter you are testing the hypothesis for.\nCommon parameters to test hypotheses are:\nProportions (for qualitative data)\nMean values (for numerical data)\nYou will learn the steps for both types in the following pages.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
