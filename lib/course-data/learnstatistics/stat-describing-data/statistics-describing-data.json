      "content": "Describing data is typically the second step of statistical analysis after gathering data.\nDescriptive Statistics\nThe information (data) from your sample or population can be visualized with graphs or\nsummarized\nby numbers. This will show key information in a simpler way than just looking at raw data. It can help us understand how the data is\ndistributed\n.\nGraphs can visually show the data distribution.\nExamples of graphs include:\nHistograms\nPie charts\nBar graphs\nBox plots\nSome graphs have a close connection to numerical summary statistics. Calculating those gives us the basis of these graphs.\nFor example, a box plot visually shows the\nquartiles\nof a data distribution.\nQuartiles are the data split into four equal size parts, or quarters. A quartile is one type of summary statistics.\nSummary statistics\nSummary statistics take a large amount of information and sums it up in a few key values.\nNumbers are calculated from the data which also describe the shape of the distributions. These are individual 'statistics'.\nSome important examples are:\nMean, median and mode\nRange\nand\ninterquartile range\nQuartiles and percentiles\nStandard deviation and variance\nNote:\nDescriptive statistics is often presented as a part of statistical analysis.\nDescriptive statistics is also useful for guiding further analysis, giving insight into the data, and finding what is worth investigating more closely.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
