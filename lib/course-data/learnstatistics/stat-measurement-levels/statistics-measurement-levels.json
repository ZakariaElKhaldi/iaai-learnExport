      "content": "Different data types have different measurement levels.\nMeasurement levels are important for what types of statistics can be calculated and how to best present the data.\nMeasurement Levels\nThe main types of data are Qualitative (categories) and Quantitative (numerical). These are further split into the following measurement levels.\nThese measurement levels are also called measurement 'scales'\nNominal Level\nCategories (qualitative data) without any order.\nExamples:\nBrand names\nCountries\nColors\nOrdinal level\nCategories that can be ordered (from low to high), but the precise \"distance\" between each is not meaningful.\nExamples:\nLetter grade scales from F to A\nMilitary ranks\nLevel of satisfaction with a product\nConsider letter grades from F to A: Is the grade A precisely twice as good as a B? And, is the grade B also twice as good as C?\nExactly how much distance it is between grades is not clear and precise. If the grades are based on amounts of points on a test, you can say that there is a precise \"distance\" on the point scale, but not the grades themselves.\nInterval Level\nData that can be ordered and the distance between them is objectively meaningful. But there is no natural 0-value where the scale originates.\nExamples:\nYears in a calendar\nTemperature measured in Fahrenheit\nNote:\nInterval scales are usually invented by people, like degrees of temperature.\n0 degrees Celsius is 32 degrees of Fahrenheit. There is consistent distances between each degree (for every 1 extra degree of \nCelsius, there is 1.8 extra Fahrenheit), but they do not agree on where 0 degrees is.\nRatio Level\nData that can be ordered and there is a consistent and meaningful distance between them. And it also has a natural 0-value.\nExamples:\nMoney\nAge\nTime\nData that is on the ratio level (or \"ratio scale\") gives us the most detailed information. Crucially, we can compare precisely how big one value is compared to another. This would be the ratio between these values, like twice as big, or ten times as small.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
