Frequency is the amount of times that value appeared in the data.\nEach interval is represented with a bar, placed \nThe height of the bar represents the frequency of values in that interval.\nHere is a histogram of the age of all 934 Nobel Prize winners up to the year 2020:\nThis histogram uses age intervals from 10 to 19, 20 to 29, and so on.\nNote:\nHistograms are similar to bar graphs, which are used for qualitative data.\nBin Width\nThe intervals of values are often called 'bins'. And the length of an interval is called 'bin width'.\nWe can choose any width. It is best with a bin width that shows enough detail without being confusing.\nHere is a histogram of the same Nobel Prize winner data, but with bin widths of 5 instead of 10:\nThis histogram uses age intervals from from 15 to 19, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, and so on.\nSmaller intervals gives a more detailed look at the distribution of the age values in the data.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
