Check firewall settings to make sure they are not blocking the connection.\nHost Key Verification Failed:\nThis happens when the server's host key changes. Verify the server's identity and update the known_hosts file by removing the old key entry.\nPermission Denied:\nCheck permissions and username. Check the server's SSH configuration for restrictions.\nTimeouts:\nCheck network connectivity and server responsiveness. Adjust the SSH timeout settings if necessary.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
