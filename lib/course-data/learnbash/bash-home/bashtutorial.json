We will keep it really simple, and learning this way gives you a good grasp of how Bash works.\nIn the code above, you can see commands (input) and output.\nLines like this are commands we input:\nExample\nbash --version\nLines like this are the output/response to our commands:\nExample\nGNU bash, version 5.2.21(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)\nCopyright (C) 2022 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later\n\nThis is free software; you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\nIn general, lines with\n$\nin front of it is input. These are the commands you can copy and run in your terminal.\nBash Exercises\nMany chapters in this tutorial end with an exercise where you can check your level of knowledge.\nSee all Bash Exercises\nBash Quiz\nLearn by taking a quiz! The quiz will give you a signal of how much you know about Bash.\nStart Bash Quiz\n\nCreate a free  account and get access to more features and learning materials:\nView your completed tutorials, exercises, and quizzes\nKeep an eye on your progress and daily streaks\nSet goals and create learning paths\nCreate your own personal website\n\nNote:\nThis is an optional feature.
