      "content": "- Remote (and local) File-copying\n\nUsing the\nrsync\nCommand\nThe\nrsync\ncommand is used to efficiently transfer and synchronize files across computer systems, by checking the timestamp and size of files.\nBasic Usage\nTo synchronize a directory to a remote host, use\nrsync -avz source user@hostname:/path\n:\nExample\nrsync -avz /local/dir/ user@example.com:/remote/dir/\nUnderstanding Rsync Output\nThe output of the\nrsync\ncommand can vary depending on the options used. Here are some common elements:\nFile List:\nLists the files being transferred.\nTransfer Progress:\nShows the progress of each file transfer.\nCompression Ratio:\nIndicates the effectiveness of compression if used.\nSpeed:\nThe speed at which files are being transferred.\nRsync Options Overview\nHere are some common options you can use with the\nrsync\ncommand:\n-a\n- Archive mode\n-v\n- Increase verbosity\n-z\n- Compress file data\n--delete\n- Delete extraneous files\n-r\n- Recurse into directories\n-u\n- Skip files that are newer on the receiver\n--progress\n- Show progress during transfer\nOption: -a (Archive Mode)",
