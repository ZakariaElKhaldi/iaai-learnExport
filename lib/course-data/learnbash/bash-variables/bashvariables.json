There should be no spaces around the equal sign:\nvariable_name=value\nTo access the value of a variable, prefix it with a dollar sign:\n$variable_name\nExample\nname=\"John Doe\"\necho \"Hello, $name!\"\nnumber=42\necho \"The number is $number\"\nEnvironment Variables\nEnvironment variables are special variables that affect the way processes run on your system. They are often used to store system-wide values like the location of executables or the default editor.\nExample: Using Environment Variables\n# Display the PATH environment variable\necho \"Your PATH is $PATH\"\nLocal vs. Global Variables\nLocal variables are only available within the block of code in which they are defined, such as within a function. Global variables are accessible from anywhere in the script.\nExample: Local Variable\n# Define a local variable in a function\nmy_function() {\n  local local_var=\"I am local\"\n  echo $local_var\n}\nmy_function\nCommon Variable Operations\nVariables can be used in various operations, such as concatenation and arithmetic.\nConcatenation:\nCombine strings using variables.\nArithmetic:\nPerform calculations using variables.\nExample: Variable Operations\n# Concatenation\ngreeting=\"Hello, \"\nname=\"World\"\necho \"$greeting$name\"",
