[FILE]...\nExample\ntail logfile.txt\nline 91\nline 92\nline 93\nline 94\nline 95\nline 96\nline 97\nline 98\nline 99\nline 100\nOptions\nThe\ntail\ncommand has several options to customize its behavior:\n-n [number]\n: Display the last [number] lines of the file.\n-f\n: Follow the file as it grows, useful for monitoring log files.\n-c [number]\n: Display the last [number] bytes of the file.\n--pid=[pid]\n: Terminate after the process with the given PID dies.\n--retry\n: Keep trying to open a file even if it is inaccessible.\nOption: -n [number]",
