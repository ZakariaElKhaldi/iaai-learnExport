Header files add functionality to C++ programs.\nLine 2:\nusing namespace std\nmeans that we can use names for objects and variables from the \nstandard library.\nDon't worry if you don't understand how\n#include <iostream>\nand\nusing namespace std\nworks. Just think of it as something that (almost) always appears in your program.\nLine 3:\nA blank line. C++ ignores white space. But we use it \nto make the code more readable.\nLine 4:\nAnother thing that always appear in a C++ program is\nint main()\n. This is called a\nfunction\n. Any code inside its curly brackets\n{}\nwill be executed.\nLine 5:\ncout\n(pronounced \"see-out\") is an\nobject\nused together with the\ninsertion operator\n(\n<<\n) \nto output/print text. In our example, it will output \"Hello World!\".\nNote:\nC++ is case-sensitive: \"cout\" and \"Cout\" has different meaning.\nNote:\nEvery C++ statement ends with a semicolon\n;\n.\nNote:\nThe body of\nint main()\ncould also been written as:\nint main () { cout << \"Hello World! \";  return 0; \n}\nRemember:\nThe compiler ignores white spaces. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.\nLine 6:\nreturn 0;\nends the main function.\nLine 7:\nDo not forget to add the closing curly bracket\n}\nto actually end the \nmain function.\nOmitting Namespace\nYou might see some C++ programs that runs without the standard namespace library. The\nusing namespace std\nline can be omitted and replaced with the\nstd\nkeyword, \nfollowed by the\n::\noperator \nfor some objects:\nExample\n#include <iostream>\nint main() {\nstd::\ncout << \"Hello World!\";\nreturn 0;\n}\n\nIt is up to you if you want to include the standard namespace library or not.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
