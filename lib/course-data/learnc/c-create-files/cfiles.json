For now, this \nline is not important. It's just something you need when working with files.\nTo actually open a file, use the\nfopen()\nfunction, which takes two parameters:\nParameter\nDescription\nfilename\nThe name of the actual file you want to open (or create), like\nfilename.txt\nmode\nA single character, which represents \n  what you want to do with the file (read, write or append):\nw\n- Writes to a file\na\n- Appends new data to a file\nr\n- Reads from a file\nCreate a File\nTo create a file, you can use the\nw\nmode inside the\nfopen()\nfunction.\nThe\nw\nmode is used to write to a file.\nHowever\n, if the file does \nnot exist, it will create one for you:\nExample\nFILE *fptr;\n// Create a file\nfptr = fopen(\"filename.txt\", \"w\");\n// Close the file\nfclose(fptr);\nNote:\nThe file is \ncreated in the same directory as your other C files, if nothing else is \nspecified.\nOn our computer, it looks like this:\nRun example \u00bb\nTip:\nIf you want to create the file in a specific folder, just provide an absolute path \n(remember to use double backslashes to create a single backslash (\n\\\n), like we specified in\nstrings special \ncharacters\n):\nfptr = fopen(\"C:\\\\directoryname\\\\filename.txt\", \"w\");\nClosing the file\nDid you notice the\nfclose()\nfunction in our example above?\nThis will close the file when we are done with it.\nIt is considered as good practice, because it makes sure that:\nChanges are saved properly\nOther programs can use the file (if you want)\nClean up unnecessary memory space\nIn the\n\n\u2605\n+1",
