      "content": "Deallocate (free) Memory\nWhen you no longer need a block of memory you should deallocate it. Deallocation is also referred to as \"freeing\" the memory.\nDynamic memory stays reserved until it is deallocated or until the program ends.\nOnce the memory is deallocated it can be used by other programs or it may even be allocated to another part of your program.\nFree Memory\nTo deallocate memory, use the\nfree()\nfunction:\nfree(\npointer\n);\nThe\npointer\nparameter is a pointer to the address of the memory to \nbe deallocated:\nint *ptr;\nptr = malloc(sizeof(*ptr));\nfree(ptr);\nptr = NULL;\nIt is considered a good practice to set a pointer to\nNULL\nafter freeing memory so that you cannot accidentally continue using it.\nIf you continue using memory after it has been freed you may corrupt data from other programs or even another part of your own program.\nExample\nA working example including error checking and freeing:\nint *ptr;\nptr = malloc(sizeof(*ptr)); // Allocate memory for one integer\n// If memory cannot be allocated, print a message and end the main() \n  function\nif (ptr == NULL) {\nprintf(\"Unable to allocate memory\");\nreturn 1;\n}\n// Set the value of the integer\n*ptr = 20;\n// Print the \n  integer value\nprintf(\"Integer value: %d\\n\", *ptr);\n// Free allocated memory\nfree(ptr);\n// Set the pointer to \n  NULL to prevent it from being accidentally used\nptr = NULL;\n\nMemory Leaks\nA\nmemory leak\nhappens when dynamic memory is allocated but never freed.\nIf a memory leak happens in a loop or in a function that is called frequently it could take up too much memory and cause the computer to slow down.\nThere is a risk of a memory leak if a pointer to dynamic memory is lost before the memory can be freed. This can happen accidentally, so it is important to be careful and keep track of pointers to dynamic memory.\nHere are some examples of how a pointer to dynamic memory may be lost.\nExample 1\nThe pointer is overwritten:\nint x = 5;\nint *ptr;\nptr = calloc(2, sizeof(*ptr));\nptr = &x;\nIn this example, after the pointer is changed to point at\nx\n, the memory allocated by\ncalloc()\ncan no longer be accessed.\nExample 2\nThe pointer exists only inside a function:\nvoid myFunction() {\nint *ptr;\nptr = malloc(sizeof(*ptr));\n}\nint main() {\nmyFunction();\nprintf(\"The function has \n  ended\");\nreturn 0;\n}\nIn this example, the memory that was allocated inside of the function remains allocated after the function ends but it cannot be accessed anymore. One way to prevent this problem is to free the memory before the function ends.\nExample 3\nThe pointer gets lost when reallocation fails:\nint* ptr;\nptr = malloc(sizeof(*ptr));\nptr = realloc(ptr, \n  2*sizeof(*ptr));\nIf\nrealloc()\nis unable to reallocate memory it will return a pointer to\nNULL\nand the original memory will remain reserved.\nIn this example, if\nrealloc()\nfails then the\nNULL\npointer is assigned to the\nptr\nvariable, overwriting the original memory address so that it cannot be accessed anymore.\nSummary\nIn summary, when managing memory in C, use \nbest practices:\nRemember to check for errors (\nNULL\nreturn \nvalues) to find out if memory allocation was sucessful or not\nPrevent memory leaks - always remember to free memory that is no longer used, \nor else the program might underperform or even worse, crash if it runs out of \nmemory\nSet the pointer to\nNULL\nafter freeing memory so that you cannot accidentally \ncontinue using it\n\n\u2605\n+1",
