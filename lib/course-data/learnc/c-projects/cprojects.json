Start small and gradually add more features:\nUnderstand how real programs are structured\nPractice combining concepts (e.g., functions, loops, file handling)\nImprove your debugging and problem-solving skills\nPrepare for job interviews and relevant exercises\nTip:\nThe more you build, the better you understand.\nProject Examples\nSome examples of fun C++ projects could be:\nCalculate a Students Average\nSimple Calculator\nAddress Book\nTo-Do List\nGuess a Number Game\nQuiz Game\nProject: Calculate a Students Average\nLet's create a program to calculate a student's average from multiple grades.\nThe program asks the user to enter 1 to 5 grades and calculates the average. Then display the average and a corresponding letter grade (A to F):\nExample\n// This function returns a letter grade based on the average\nchar gradeFunction(double avg) {\nif (avg >= 90) return 'A';\nelse if (avg >= 80) return 'B';\nelse if (avg >= 70) return 'C';\nelse if (avg >= 60) return 'D';\nelse return 'F';\n}\nint main() {\nint count; // Number of grades the user wants to enter\ndouble sum = 0, grade; \n    // Sum stores total grades, grade holds each input\n// Ask the \n    user to enter total grades between 1 to 5\ncout << \"How many \n    grades (1 to 5)? \";\ncin >> count;\n// \n    Validate that count is between 1 and 5\nif (count < 1 || \n    count > 5) {\ncout << \"Invalid number. You must enter \n    between 1 and 5 grades.\\n\";\nreturn 1;\u00a0 // Exit\n}\n// Loop to collect each grade\nfor (int i = 1; i <= count; i++) {\ncout << \"Enter grade \" << i << \": \";\ncin >> grade;\nsum += grade;\n}\n// Calculate the average score\ndouble avg = sum / count;\n// Display numeric average\ncout << \"Average: \" << avg << \"\\n\";\n// Display letter grade\ncout << \"Letter grade: \" << \n    gradeFunction(avg) << \"\\n\";\nreturn 0;\n}\nExample output:\nHow many grades (1 to 5)? 3\nEnter grade 1: 85\nEnter grade 2: 91\nEnter grade 3: 78\nAverage: 84.6667\nLetter grade: B\nRun example \u00bb\nKey Concepts Used:\nloops, functions, conditions, input handling, and basic logic.\nPractice Challenge\nTry to make your own projects. For example, write a program that:\nAsks for your name\nAsks for your age\nPrints:\nHi <name>! You will turn <age+1> \nOpen CodeBlocks or any similar C++ IDE, and experiment on your own!\nTip:\nStart small. Add one feature at a time. Test often!\n\n\u2605\n+1",
