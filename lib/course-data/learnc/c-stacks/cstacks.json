      "content": "C++ Stack\nA stack stores multiple elements in a specific order, called\nLIFO\n.\nLIFO\nstands for\nLast in, First Out\n. To vizualise LIFO, think of a pile of pancakes, \nwhere pancakes are both added and removed from the top. So when removing a pancake, it will always be the last \none you added. This way of organizing elements is called LIFO in computer \nscience and programming.\nUnlike\nvectors\n, elements in the stack are not \naccessed by index numbers. Since elements are added and removed from the top, you can only access the element at the top of the stack.\nTo use a stack, you have to include the\n<stack>\nheader file:\n// Include the stack library\n#include <stack>\nCreate a Stack\nTo create a stack, use the\nstack\nkeyword, \nand specify the\ntype\nof values it should store within angle brackets\n<>\nand then the name of the stack, like:\nstack<\ntype\n>\nstackName\n.\n// Create a \n  stack of strings called cars\nstack<string> cars;\nNote:\nThe type of the stack (string in our example) cannot be changed after its been declared.\nNote:\nYou cannot add elements to the stack at the time of declaration, like you can with\nvectors\n:\nstack<string> cars = {\"Volvo\", \"BMW\", \n  \"Ford\", \"Mazda\"};\nAdd Elements\nTo add elements to the stack, use the\n.push()\nfunction, after declaring the stack:\nExample\n// Create a stack of strings called cars\nstack<string> cars;\n// \n  Add elements to the stack\ncars.push(\"Volvo\");\ncars.push(\"BMW\");\ncars.push(\"Ford\");\ncars.push(\"Mazda\");\nThe stack will look like this (remember that the last element added is the top element):\nMazda (top element)\nFord\nBMW\nVolvo\nAccess Stack Elements\nYou cannot access stack elements by referring to index numbers, like you would with\narrays\nand\nvectors\n.\nIn a stack, you can only access the top element, which is done using the\n.top()\nfunction:\nExample\n// Access the top element\ncout << cars.top();\u00a0 // Outputs \n    \"Mazda\"\n\nChange the Top Element\nYou can also use the\n.top\nfunction to change the value of the top element:\nExample\n// \n    Change the value of the top element\ncars.top() = \"Tesla\";\n// \n    Access the top element\ncout << cars.top();\u00a0 // Now outputs \"Tesla\" \n    instead of \"Mazda\"\n\nRemove Elements\nYou can use the\n.pop()\nfunction to remove an element from the stack.\nThis will remove the last element that was added to the stack:\nExample\n// Create a stack of strings called cars\nstack<string> cars;\n// \n  Add elements to the stack\ncars.push(\"Volvo\");\ncars.push(\"BMW\");\ncars.push(\"Ford\");\ncars.push(\"Mazda\");\n// Remove the \n  last added \n  element (Mazda)\ncars.pop();\n// Access the top \n  element (Now Ford)\ncout << cars.top();\n\nGet the Size of the Stack\nTo find out how many elements a stack has, use the\n.size()\nfunction:\nExample\ncout \n  << cars.size();\n\nCheck if the Stack is Empty\nUse the\n.empty()\nfunction to find out if the \nstack is empty or not.\nThe\n.empty()\nfunction returns\n1\n(\ntrue\n) if the stack is empty and\n0\n(\nfalse\n) \notherwise:\nExample\nstack<string> cars;\ncout << cars.empty(); \n  // Outputs 1 (The stack is empty)\n\nExample\nstack<string> cars;\ncars.push(\"Volvo\");\ncars.push(\"BMW\");\ncars.push(\"Ford\");\ncars.push(\"Mazda\");\ncout \n  << cars.empty();\u00a0 \n  // Outputs 0 (not empty)\n\nStacks and Queues\nStacks are often mentioned together with\nQueues\n, which is a similar data structure described on the\n\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
