Instead, you must use the\nchar\ntype and create an\narray\nof characters to make a \"string\" in C.\nAs C++ was developed as an extension of C, it continued to support this way of creating strings in C++:\nExample\nstring greeting1 = \"Hello\";\u00a0 // Regular String\nchar greeting2[] = \n  \"Hello\";\u00a0 // C-Style String (an array of characters)\n\nNote:\nIt is more convenient to work with the standard\nstring\ntype, rather than C-style strings. However, one reason some users continue to \nuse C-style strings is that \nthey have access to functions from the C standard library.\nA list of all C-style string functions, can be found in our\nCString Functions Reference\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
