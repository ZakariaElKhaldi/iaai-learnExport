It is updated and improved frequently.\nThe syllabus outline and its sequence are structured so you can learn C# step by step, from the introduction to creating your first application with C#.\nGet Started With C# \u00bb\nLearning Outcomes\nUnderstand C# and set up a development environment.\nLearn C#, including syntax, variables, data types, and operators.\nUse control structures such as if statements, for loops, and while loops.\nUnderstand and apply object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts: classes, objects, and inheritance.\nCreate and use methods to organize your code and make it easier to understand.\nHandle errors in your code and write code to manage them properly.\nWrite and run C# programs.\nNote:\nAre you a teacher teaching C# programming?\n Academy\nis a toolbox of features that can help you teach. It offers classroom features such as pre-built study plans, classroom administration and much more. Read more about\nAcademy here\n.\nWhich Subjects Are C# Relevant For?\nComputer Science:\nC# is used to teach programming, software development, and object-oriented programming (OOP).\nMathematics:\nC# can be used for solving math problems and creating algorithms.\nEngineering:\nC# is used for building software and tools for projects.\nGame Development:\nC# is popular for creating games, particularly with game engines like Unity.\nInformation Technology (IT):\nC# is used to develop software applications and understand how systems work.\nBusiness and Data Analysis:\nC# can be used to create applications for analyzing business data and for automating tasks.\nWeb Development:\nC# is used for building web applications and services using frameworks like ASP.NET.\nC# can help you learn problem-solving and develop programming skills.\nGet Started\nActivities\nIn this tutorial we offer different activities for you to learn C# for free:\nLessons\nExercises\nQuizzes\nSign in to Track Progress\nYou can also create a free account to \nAs a signed-in user, you get access to features such as:\nLearning paths\nSandbox and lab environments\nAchievements\nAnd much more!\n\nOverview of the Modules\nC# HOME\nC# Introduction\nC# Get Started\nC# Syntax\nC# Output\nC# Comments\nC# Variables\nC# Data Types\nC# Type Casting\nC# User Input\nC# Operators\nC# Math\nC# Strings\nC# Booleans\nC# If...Else (Conditions)\nC# Switch\nC# While Loop\nC# For Loop\nC# Break/Continue\nC# Arrays\nC# Methods\nC# Method Parameters\nC# Method Overloading\nC# OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)\nC# Classes/Objects\nC# Class Members\nC# Constructors\nC# Access Modifiers\nC# Properties\nC# Inheritance\nC# Polymorphism\nC# Abstraction\nC# Interface\nC# Enums\nC# Files\nC# Exceptions\nGet Started\nSandbox and Lab Environment\nC#, like any other programming language, is best learned by working hands-on with code.\nEasily try code with our \"\nHere, you can edit C# code and view the result:\nExample\nusing System;\n\nnamespace HelloWorld\n{\n  class Program\n  {\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n      Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");    \n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIf you want to explore more and host your project, we have a feature called\nSpaces\nthat allows you to build, test and deploy C# code and other backend languages.\nHere you get a secure sandbox environment called Spaces, where you can practice coding and test projects in real-time.\nSpaces allow you to test, build, and deploy code. This includes a  subdomain, hosting, and secure SSL certificates.\nSpaces require no installation and run directly in the browser.\nFeatures include:\nCollaboration\nFile navigator\nTerminal & log\nPackage manager\nDatabase\nEnvironment manager\nAnalytics\nCreate a Spaces Account\nC# Certification\n offers an end-of-pathway certification program.\nHere you can take exams to get certified.\nThe C# exam is a test that summarizes the  C# syllabus.\nAfter passing the exam you get the \"Certified C# Developer\" Certification.\nThere are two different types of certifications:\nNon-adaptive\nAdaptive\nThe non-adaptive is pass or no pass.\nThe adaptive certification is adaptive and graded; students will get a grade from intermediate, advanced to professional.\nBuy Certificate \u00bb\nAre You a Teacher?\nAre you interested in learning how you can use\n Academy\nto Teach \nC#?\nWatch a demo of\n Academy\n.
