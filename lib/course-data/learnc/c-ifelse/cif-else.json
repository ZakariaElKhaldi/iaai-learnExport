Uppercase letters (If or IF) will generate an error.\nIn the example below, we test two values to find out if 20 is greater than \n18. If the condition is\nTrue\n, print some text:\nExample\nif (20 > 18) \n{\n\u00a0 Console.WriteLine(\"20 is greater than 18\");\n}\n\nWe can also test variables:\nExample\nint x = 20;\nint y = 18;\nif (x > y) \n{\n\u00a0 Console.WriteLine(\"x is greater than y\");\n}\n\nExample explained\nIn the example above we use two variables,\nx\nand\ny\n, \nto test whether x is greater than y \n(using the\n>\noperator). As x is 20, and y is 18, and we know that 20 is greater than 18, we print to the screen that \"x is greater than y\".\n\n\u2605\n+1",
