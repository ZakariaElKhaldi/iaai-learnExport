      "content": "The process of reserving memory is called allocation. The way to allocate memory depends on the type of memory.\nC has two types of memory: Static memory and dynamic memory.\nStatic Memory\nStatic memory is memory that is reserved for variables\nbefore\nthe program runs. Allocation of static memory is also known as\ncompile time\nmemory allocation.\nC automatically allocates memory for every variable when the program is compiled.\nFor example, if you create an integer array of 20 students (e.g. for a summer semester), C will reserve space for 20 elements which is typically 80 bytes of memory (20 * 4):\nExample\nint students[20];\nprintf(\"%lu\", sizeof(students)); // 80 bytes\n\nBut when the semester starts, it turns out that only 12 students are attending. Then you have wasted the space of 8 unused elements.\nSince you are not able to change the size of the array, you are left with unnecessary reserved memory.\nNote that the program will still run, and it is not damaged in any way. But if your program contains a lot of this kind of code, it may run slower than it optimally could.\nIf you want better control of allocated memory, take a look at Dynamic Memory below.\nDynamic Memory\nDynamic memory is memory that is allocated\nafter\nthe program starts running. Allocation of dynamic memory can also be referred to as\nruntime\nmemory allocation.\nUnlike with static memory, you have full control over how much memory is being used at any time. You can write code to determine how much memory you need and allocate it.\nDynamic memory does not belong to a variable, it can only be accessed with pointers.\nTo allocate dynamic memory, you can use the\nmalloc()\nor\ncalloc()\nfunctions. It is necessary to include the\n<stdlib.h>\nheader to use them. The\nmalloc()\nand\ncalloc()\nfunctions allocate some memory and return a pointer to its address.\nint *ptr1 = malloc(\nsize\n);\nint *ptr2 = calloc(\namount\n,\nsize\n);\nThe\nmalloc()\nfunction has one parameter,\nsize\n, which specifies how much memory to allocate, measured in bytes.\nThe\ncalloc()\nfunction has two parameters:\namount\n- Specifies the amount of items to allocate\nsize\n- Specifies the size of each item measured in bytes\nNote:\nThe data in the memory allocated by\nmalloc()\nis unpredictable. To avoid unexpected values, make sure to write something into the memory before reading it.\nUnlike\nmalloc()\n, the\ncalloc()\nfunction writes zeroes into all of the allocated memory. However, this makes\ncalloc()\nslightly less efficient.\nThe best way to allocate the right amount of memory for a data type is to use the\nsizeof\noperator:\nint *ptr1, *ptr2;\nptr1 = malloc(sizeof(*ptr1));\nptr2 = calloc(1, sizeof(*ptr2));\nBe careful:\nsizeof(*ptr1)\ntells C to measure the size of the data at the address. If you forget the\n*\nand write\nsizeof(ptr1)\ninstead, it will measure the size of the pointer itself, which is the (usually) 8 bytes that are needed to store a memory address.\nNote:\nThe\nsizeof\noperator cannot measure how much dynamic memory is allocated. When measuring dynamic memory, it only tells you the size of the\ndata type\nof the memory. For example, if you reserve space for 5\nfloat\nvalues, the\nsizeof\noperator will return 4, which is the number of bytes needed for a single\nfloat\nvalue.\nLet's use dynamic memory to improve the students example above.\nAs noted \nsizeof\nto \nmeasure how much memory was allocated, we have to calculate that by multiplying \nthe amount of items by the size of the data type:\nExample\nint *students;\nint numStudents = 12;\nstudents = calloc(numStudents, \n  sizeof(*students));\nprintf(\"%d\", numStudents * sizeof(*students)); // 48 \n  bytes\n\nNotes\nWhen working with dynamic memory allocation, you should also\ncheck for errors\nand\nfree memory\nat the end of the program. You will learn more about this in the \nStack Memory\nFor completeness, it is worth mentioning stack memory. Stack memory is a type of dynamic memory which is reserved for variables that are declared inside functions. Variables declared inside a function use stack memory rather than static memory.\nWhen a function is called, stack memory is allocated for the variables in the function. When the function returns the stack memory is freed.\nIt is good to be aware of stack memory to be able to handle the memory usage of nested function calls and recursion. Recursion that repeats itself too many times may take up too much stack memory. When that happens it is called a\nstack overflow\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
