Note that it will add a new line for each method:\nExample\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"I am Learning C#\");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"It is awesome!\");\n\nYou can also output numbers, and perform mathematical calculations:\nExample\nConsole.WriteLine(3 + 3);\n\nThe Write Method\nThere is also a\nWrite()\nmethod, which is similar to\nWriteLine()\n.\nThe only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:\nExample\nConsole.Write(\"Hello World! \");\nConsole.Write(\"I will print on the same line.\");\n\nNote that we add an extra space when needed (after \"Hello World!\" in the example above), for better readability.\nIn this tutorial, we will only use\nWriteLine()\nas it makes it easier to read the output of code.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
