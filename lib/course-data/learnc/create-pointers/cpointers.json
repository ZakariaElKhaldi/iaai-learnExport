The address of the variable you're working with is assigned to the pointer:\nExample\nstring food = \"Pizza\";\u00a0 // A food variable \n    of type string\nstring* ptr = \n    &food;\n// A pointer variable, with the name \n    ptr, that stores the \n    address of food\n// Output the value of food (Pizza)\ncout << food << \"\\n\";\n// Output \n    the memory address of food (0x6dfed4)\ncout << &food << \"\\n\";\n// \n    Output the memory address of food with the pointer (0x6dfed4)\ncout << \n    ptr << \"\\n\";\n\nExample explained\nCreate a pointer variable with the name\nptr\n, that\npoints to\na\nstring\nvariable, by using the \nasterisk sign\n*\n(\nstring* ptr\n). \nNote that the type of the pointer has to match the type of the variable you're \nworking with.\nUse the\n&\noperator to store the memory address of the \nvariable called\nfood\n, and assign it to the pointer.\nNow,\nptr\nholds the value of\nfood\n's memory address.\nTip:\nThere are three ways to declare pointer variables, but the first way is preferred:\nstring* mystring; // Preferred\nstring *mystring;\nstring * mystring;\n\n\u2605\n+1",
