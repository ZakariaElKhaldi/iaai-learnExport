For now, focus on how to run the code.\nRun the program by pressing the\nF5\nbutton on your keyboard (or click on \"\nDebug\n\" -> \"\nStart Debugging\n\"). This will compile and execute your code. The result will look something to this:\nHello World!\nC:\\Users\\Username\\source\\repos\\HelloWorld\\HelloWorld\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp3.0\\HelloWorld.exe (process 13784) exited with code 0.\nTo automatically close the console when debugging stops, enable Tools->Options->Debugging->Automatically close the console when debugging stops.\nPress any key to close this window . . .\nCongratulations\n! You have now written and executed your first C# program.\nLearning C# At \nWhen learning C# at .com, you can use our \"\nyou to understand every part as we move forward:\nProgram.cs\nusing System;\n\nnamespace HelloWorld\n{\n  class Program\n  {\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n      Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");    \n    }\n  }\n}\nResult:\nHello World!\n\n\u2605\n+1",
