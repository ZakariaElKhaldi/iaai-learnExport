      "content": "Data Structures\nData structures are used to store and organize data. An\narray\nis an example of a data structure, which \nallows multiple elements to be stored in a single variable.\nC++ includes many other data structures as well, each is used to handle data \nin different ways.\nThese are part of the C++ STL, which stands for The\nS\ntandard\nT\nemplate\nL\nibrary.\nC++ STL\nSTL is a library that consist of different\ndata structures\nand\nalgorithms\nto effectively store and manipulate data.\nIf we say that data structures store data, we can say that algorithms are used to solve different problems, \noften by searching through and manipulating those data structures.\nUsing the right data structure and algorithm makes your program run faster, \nespecially when working with lots of data.\nThe most common data structures are:\nData Structure\nDescription\nVector\nStores elements like an\narray\nbut can \n    dynamically change in size. Adding and removing of elements are usually done \n    at the end. Elements can be accessed by index.\nList\nStores elements sequentially, where each element is connected to the\n\naccessible by index.\nStack\nStores elements in a specific order, called LIFO (Last In, First Out), \n    where elements can only be added and removed from the top. Not accessible by \n    index.\nQueue\nStores elements in a specific order, called FIFO (First In, First Out), \n    where elements are added at the end and removed from the front. Not \n    accessible by index.\nDeque\nStores elements in a double-ended queue, where elements can be added and \n    removed from both ends. Elements can be accessed by index.\nSet\nStores unique elements. Not accessible by index.\nMap\nStores elements in \"key/value\" pairs. Accessible by keys (not by index).\nWhich one to use depends on your specific needs. One thing they all have in common is that you must include the \nappropriate header file to use them:\nExample\n// Include the vector library\n#include <vector>\n// Include the list library\n#include <list>\n// Include the set \n  library\n#include <set>\n// Include the map library\n#include <map>\n// Include the stack library\n#include <stack>\n// \n  Include the queue library\n#include <queue>\nHere is an example of using vectors, after we have included the\n<vector>\nlibrary:\nExample\n// Create a vector called cars that will store strings\nvector<string> cars = {\"Volvo\", \"BMW\", \n  \"Ford\", \"Mazda\"};\n// Print vector elements\nfor (string car : cars) {\ncout << car << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nThe \nKey Concepts of the STL\nThe key components of the STL consist of\ncontainers\n,\niterators,\nand\nalgorithms\n, and the relationship betweem them:\nContainers\nare data structures that provides a way to store data, like\nvectors\n,\nlists\n, etc.\nIterators\nare objects used to access elements of \na data structure.\nAlgorithms\ninclude functions, like\nsort()\nand\nfind()\n, \nthat perform operations on data structures through\niterators\n.\nIn Computer Science, data structures and algorithms go hand in hand. A data structure is not worth \nmuch if you cannot search through it or manipulate it efficiently using \nalgorithms, and algorithms are not worth much without a data structure to work \non.\nIn the following chapters, you will see how everything is connected.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
