Note \nthat \nyou may not get the same result in your program.\nAnd why is it useful to know the memory address?\nReferences\nand\nPointers\n(which you will learn about in the \n  are important in C++, because they give you the \nability to manipulate the data in the computer's memory -\nwhich can reduce the code and improve the performance\n.\nThese two features are one of the things that make C++ stand out from other \n  programming languages, like\nPython\nand\nJava\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
