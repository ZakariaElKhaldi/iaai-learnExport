For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has\nattributes\n, such as weight and color, and\nmethods\n, such as drive and brake.\nA Class is like an object constructor, or a \"blueprint\" for creating objects.\nCreate a Class\nTo create a class, use the\nclass\nkeyword:\nCreate a class named \"\nCar\n\" with a variable\ncolor\n:\nclass Car \n{\n\u00a0 string color = \"red\";\n}\nWhen a variable is declared directly in a class, it is often referred to as a\nfield\n(or attribute).\nIt is not required, but it is a good practice to start with an uppercase first letter when naming classes. Also, it is common that the name of the C# file and the class matches, as it makes our code organized. However it is not required (like in Java).\nCreate an Object\nAn object is created from a class. We have already created the class named\nCar\n, \nso now we can use this to create objects.\nTo create an object of\nCar\n, \nspecify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keyword\nnew\n:\nExample\nCreate an object called \"\nmyObj\n\" and use \nit to print the value of\ncolor\n:\nclass Car \n{\n\u00a0 string color = \"red\";\n\n\u00a0 static void Main(string[] args)\n  {",
