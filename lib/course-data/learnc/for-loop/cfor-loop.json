      "content": "C# For Loop\nWhen you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of \ncode, use the\nfor\nloop instead of a\nwhile\nloop:\nSyntax\nfor (\nstatement 1\n;\nstatement 2\n;\nstatement 3\n) \n{\n// code block to be executed\n}\nStatement 1\nis executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.\nStatement 2\ndefines the condition for executing the code block.\nStatement 3\nis executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.\nThe example below will print the numbers 0 to 4:\nExample\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) \n{\n\u00a0\u00a0Console.WriteLine(i);\n}\n\nExample explained\nStatement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (\nint i = 0\n).\nStatement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (\ni\nmust be less than\n5\n). If the condition is\ntrue\n, the loop will start over again, if it is\nfalse\n, \nthe loop will end.\nStatement 3 increases a value (\ni++\n) each time the code block in the loop has \nbeen executed.\nAnother Example\nThis example will only print even values between 0 and 10:\nExample\nfor (int i = 0; i <= 10; i = i + 2) \n{\n\u00a0\u00a0Console.WriteLine(i);\n}\n\nNested Loops\nIt is also possible to place a loop inside another loop. This is called a\nnested loop\n.\nThe \"inner loop\" will be executed one time for each iteration of the \"outer loop\":\nExample\n// Outer loop\nfor (int i = 1; i <= 2; ++i) \n{\n  Console.WriteLine(\"Outer: \" + i);  // Executes 2 times\n\n// Inner loop\n  for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) \n  {\n    Console.WriteLine(\" Inner: \" + j); // Executes 6 times (2 * 3)\n  }\n}\n\n\u2605\n+1",
