      "content": "Now that you understand how functions work, it is important to \nlearn how variables act inside and outside of functions.\nIn C++, variables are only accessible inside the region they are created. This is called\nscope\n.\nLocal Scope\nA variable created inside a function belongs to the\nlocal scope\nof that function, and can only be used inside that function:\nExample\nvoid myFunction() {\n// Local variable that belongs to myFunction\nint x = 5;\n// Print the variable x\ncout << x;\n}\nint main() {\nmyFunction();\nreturn 0;\n}\n\nA\nlocal variable\ncannot be used outside the function it belongs to.\nIf you try to access it outside the function, an error occurs:\nExample\nvoid myFunction() {\n// Local variable that belongs to myFunction\nint x = 5;\n}\nint main() {\nmyFunction();\n// Print \n  the variable x in the main function\ncout << x;\nreturn 0;\n}\n\nGlobal Scope\nA variable created outside of a function, is called a\nglobal variable\nand \nbelongs to the\nglobal scope\n.\nGlobal variables are available from within any scope, global and local:\nExample\nA variable created outside of a function is global and can therefore be used by anyone:\n// Global variable x\nint x = 5;\nvoid myFunction() {\n// \n  We can use x here\ncout << x << \"\\n\";\n}\nint main() {\nmyFunction();\n// We can also use x here\ncout << x;\nreturn 0;\n}\n\nNaming Variables\nIf you operate with the same variable name inside and outside of a function, \nC++ will treat them as two separate variables; One available in the global scope (outside the function) and one available in the local scope (inside the function):\nExample\nThe function will print the local\nx\n, and \n  then the code will print the global\nx\n:\n// Global variable x\nint x = 5;\nvoid myFunction() {\n// \n    Local variable with the same name as the global variable (x)\nint x \n    = 22;\ncout << x << \"\\n\"; // Refers to the local variable x\n}\nint main() \n    {\nmyFunction();\ncout << x; // Refers to the global \n    variable x\nreturn 0;\n}\n\nHowever, you should avoid using the same variable name for both globally and locally variables as it can lead to errors and confusion.\nIn general, you should be careful with global variables, since they can be \naccessed and modified from any function:\nExample\nChange the value of\nx\nfrom\nmyFunction\n:\n// Global variable x\nint x = 5;\nvoid myFunction() {\ncout << ++x << \"\\n\"; // Increment the value of x by 1 and print it\n}\nint \n    main() {\nmyFunction();\ncout << x; // Print the \n    global variable x\nreturn 0;\n}\n// The value of \n    x is now 6 (no longer 5)\n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, use local variables (with good variable names) as much as you can. This will make your code easier to maintain and \nbetter to understand. However, you may find global variables when working on existing C++ programs or \nwhile collaborating with others. Therefore, it is good to understand how the scope works and how to use it effectively to make sure your code is clear and functional.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
