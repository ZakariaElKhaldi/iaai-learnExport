Note that the type of the pointer has to match the type of the variable you're \nworking with (\nint\nin our example).\nUse the\n&\noperator to store the memory address of the\nmyAge\nvariable, and assign it to the pointer.\nNow,\nptr\nholds the value of\nmyAge\n's memory address.\nDereference\nIn the example above, we used the pointer variable to get the memory address of a variable (used together with the\n&\nreference\noperator).\nYou can also get the value of the variable the pointer points to, by using the\n*\noperator (the\ndereference\noperator):\nExample\nint myAge = 43;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 // Variable declaration\nint* ptr = &myAge;\u00a0 // Pointer \n    declaration\n// Reference: Output the memory address of myAge with the \n    pointer (0x7ffe5367e044)\nprintf(\"%p\\n\", ptr);\n// Dereference: \n    Output the value of myAge with the pointer (43)\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", *ptr);\n\nNote that the\n*\nsign can be confusing here, as it does two different things \nin our code:\nWhen used in declaration (\nint* ptr\n), it creates a\npointer variable\n.\nWhen not used in declaration, it act as a\ndereference operator\n.\nGood To Know:\nThere are two ways to declare pointer \nvariables in C:\nint* myNum;\nint *myNum;\nNotes on Pointers\nPointers are one of the things that make C stand out from other \n  programming languages, like\nPython\nand\nJava\n.\nThey are important in C, because they allow us to manipulate the data in the computer's memory. \nThis can reduce the code and improve the performance. If you are familiar with \ndata structures like lists, trees and graphs, you should know that pointers are \nespecially useful for implementing those. And sometimes you even have to use \npointers, for example when working with\nfiles\nand\nmemory management\n.\nBut be careful\n; pointers must be handled with care, since it is possible to damage data stored in other memory addresses.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
