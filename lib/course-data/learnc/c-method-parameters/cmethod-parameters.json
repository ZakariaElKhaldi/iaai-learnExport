Parameters act as variables inside the method.\nThey are specified after the method name, inside the parentheses.\nYou can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma.\nThe following example has a \nmethod that takes a\nstring\ncalled\nfname\nas parameter.\nWhen the method is called, we pass along a first name,\nwhich is used inside the method to print the full name:\nExample\nstatic void MyMethod(string fname) \n{\n\u00a0 Console.WriteLine(fname + \" Refsnes\");\n}\n\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\n\u00a0 MyMethod(\"Liam\");\n\u00a0 MyMethod(\"Jenny\");\n\u00a0 MyMethod(\"Anja\");\n}\n\n// Liam Refsnes\n// Jenny Refsnes\n// Anja Refsnes\n\nWhen a\nparameter\nis passed to the method, it is called an\nargument\n. So, from the example above:\nfname\nis a\nparameter\n, while\nLiam\n,\nJenny\nand\nAnja\nare\narguments\n.\nMultiple Parameters\nYou can have as many parameters as you like, just separate them with commas:\nExample\nstatic void MyMethod(string fname, int age) \n{\n\u00a0 Console.WriteLine(fname + \" is \" + age);\n}\n\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\n\u00a0 MyMethod(\"Liam\", 5);\n\u00a0 MyMethod(\"Jenny\", 8);\n\u00a0 MyMethod(\"Anja\", 31);\n}\n\n// Liam is 5\n// Jenny is 8\n// Anja is 31\n\nNote that when you are working with multiple parameters, the method call must \nhave the same number of arguments as there are parameters, and the arguments must be passed in the same order.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
