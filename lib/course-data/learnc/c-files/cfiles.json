If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.\nFor a full list of File methods, go to\nMicrosoft .Net File Class Reference\n.\nWrite To a File and Read It\nIn the \nfollowing example, we use the\nWriteAllText()\nmethod \nto create a file named \"filename.txt\" and write some content to it. Then we use the\nReadAllText()\nmethod to read the contents of the file:\nExample\nusing System.IO;  // include the System.IO namespace\n\nstring writeText = \"Hello World!\";  // Create a text string\nFile.WriteAllText(\"filename.txt\", writeText);  // Create a file and write the content of writeText to it\n\nstring readText = File.ReadAllText(\"filename.txt\");  // Read the contents of the file\nConsole.WriteLine(readText);  // Output the content\nThe output will be:\nHello World!\nRun example \u00bb\n\n\u2605\n+1",
