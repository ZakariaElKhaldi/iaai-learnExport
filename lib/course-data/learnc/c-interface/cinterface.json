      "content": "Interfaces\nAnother way to achieve\nabstraction\nin C#, is with interfaces.\nAn\ninterface\nis a completely \"\nabstract class\n\", \nwhich can only contain abstract methods and properties (with empty bodies):\nExample\n// interface\ninterface Animal \n{\n\u00a0 void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)\n\u00a0 void run(); // interface method (does not have a body)\n}\nIt is considered good practice to start with the letter \"I\" at the beginning of an interface, as it makes it easier for yourself and others to remember that \nit is an interface and not a class.\nBy default, members of an interface are\nabstract\nand\npublic\n.\nNote:\nInterfaces can contain properties and methods, but \n  not fields.\nTo access the interface methods, the interface must be \"implemented\" (kinda \nlike inherited) by another class. To implement an interface, use the\n:\nsymbol (just like with inheritance). The body of the interface method is \nprovided by the \"implement\" class. Note that you do not have to use the\noverride\nkeyword when implementing an interface:\nExample\n// Interface\ninterface IAnimal \n{\n\u00a0 void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)\n}\n\n// Pig \"implements\" the IAnimal interface\nclass Pig : IAnimal \n{\n\u00a0 public void animalSound() \n  {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 // The body of animalSound() is provided here\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Console.WriteLine(\"The pig says: wee wee\");\n\u00a0 }\n}\n\nclass Program \n{\n\u00a0 static void Main(string[] args) \n  {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pig myPig = new Pig();\u00a0 // Create a Pig object\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 myPig.animalSound();\n\u00a0 }\n}\n\nNotes on Interfaces:\nLike\nabstract classes\n, interfaces\ncannot\nbe used to create objects (in the example above, \nit is not possible to create an \"IAnimal\" object in the Program class)\nInterface methods do not have a body - the \nbody is provided by the \"implement\" class\nOn implementation of an interface, you must override all of its methods\nInterfaces can contain properties and methods, but not \n  fields/variables\nInterface members are by default\nabstract\nand\npublic\nAn interface cannot contain a constructor (as it cannot be used to create objects)\nWhy And When To Use Interfaces?\n1) To achieve security - hide certain details and only show the important \ndetails of an object (interface).\n2) C# does not support \"multiple inheritance\" (a class can only inherit from one \n  base class). However, it can be achieved \n  with interfaces, because the class can\nimplement\nmultiple interfaces.\nNote:\nTo implement multiple interfaces, separate them with a comma (see example in the\n\n\u2605\n+1",
