      "content": "Memory Address\nWhen a variable is created in C, a memory address is assigned to the variable.\nThe memory address is the \nlocation of where the variable is stored on the computer.\nWhen we assign a value to the variable, it is stored in this memory \naddress.\nTo access it, use the reference \noperator (\n&\n), and the result represents where the variable is stored:\nExample\nint myAge = 43;\nprintf(\"%p\",\n&myAge\n); // Outputs 0x7ffe5367e044\n\nNote:\nThe memory address is in hexadecimal form (0x..). You \nwill probably not get the same result in your program, as this depends on where \nthe variable is stored on your computer.\nYou should also note that\n&myAge\nis often called a \"pointer\". A pointer basically stores the memory address of a variable as its value. To print pointer values, \nwe use the\n%p\nformat specifier.\nYou will learn much more about\npointers\nin the \nWhy is it useful to know the memory address?\nPointers\nare important in C, because they allow us to manipulate the data in the computer's memory -\nthis can reduce the code and improve the performance\n.\nPointers are one of the things that make C stand out from other \n  programming languages, like\nPython\nand\nJava\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
