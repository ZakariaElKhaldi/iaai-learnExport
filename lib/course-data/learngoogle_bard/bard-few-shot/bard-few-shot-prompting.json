This is called \"Few Shot\" prompting.\nFew-shot prompting is helpful when you want a response to be structured in a specific way.\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nA conversation between Kai, the author of a GPT-3.5 tutorial, and a student:\nStudent: Why should I learn about Prompt Engineering?\nKai: Because Generative AI can really boost your productivity if used correctly, and knowing how to write prompts correctly is the key to helping you use generative AIs.\nStudent: What will I learn from this tutorial?\nKai: This tutorial gives step-by-step guides on how to write AI prompts to get the best possible results from Bard. You will learn to understand Bard's capabilities and write prompts that minimize misinformation and biased results.\nStudent: That sounds interesting. Can you give me an example of how Prompt Engineering can be used in real-world applications?\nKai: Prompt Engineering can be used in a wide range of applications, such as content creation, customer service, and even scientific research. For example, let's say you're running a content creation platform and want to generate engaging article titles for your writers. Using Prompt Engineering techniques, you can write prompts that will help create article titles that are attention-grabbing and relevant to your readers. Another example is using generative AI to answer customer service inquiries. By writing well-crafted prompts, you can ensure that the AI responses are accurate and helpful, leading to higher customer satisfaction.\nStudent:\nA response from Bard could be:\nBard continues with our example, providing a question and answer in the same area of conversation.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
