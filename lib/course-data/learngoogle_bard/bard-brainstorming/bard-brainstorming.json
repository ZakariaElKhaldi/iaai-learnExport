Finding a name for a cat? In this example, we will brainstorm ideas for activities for a birthday party for five-year-old girls.\nAsk Open-Ended Questions\nUnlike when you ask Bard for something specific, it is important to keep it open-ended for brainstorming sessions. This will give you a wider range of responses:\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nWhat are some unique ideas for activities for 10 five-year-old girls at a birthday party?\nA response from Bard could be:\nThat is a good list of starting points. Let's narrow it down, then expand it further.\nFollow-Ups with more Details\nFrom the list above, let's move forward with ideas 2 and 4. Combine them into one for craft picnic!\nTo get more details, we can ask Bard to add unique details:\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nCombine ideas 2 and 4. Make this into a unique experience that the children will remember.\nA response from Bard could be:\nNow that sounds like a good time!\nRefine Further\nNow we have our key idea, let's refine it further.\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nHow can we make this more social for the girls? I am worried they will lose interest, making it more difficult to organize. How can we make it more of a thing they do together?\nA response from Bard could be:\nThat was an example of how you can start with a basic idea and, with the help of Bard, transform it into something unique.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
