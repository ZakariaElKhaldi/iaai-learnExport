It can condense a lot of information into key points.\nWhat do you Need to Understand?\nBefore we start to ask Bard, we need to figure out what we are trying to understand.\nBe as specific as possible. For example, if we ask for an explanation of something general, we get a general (and often long) response:\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nExplain the play \"Romeo and Juliet\" written by \"William Shakespeare\".\nA response from Bard could be:\nLet's try for a more specific explanation:\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nExplain how \"Romeo and Juliet\" written by \"William Shakespeare\" became such a historically important work.\nA response from Bard could be:\nNow let's try to make it simpler and shorter:\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nExplain to a 5-year-old how \"Romeo and Juliet\" written by \"William Shakespeare\" became such a historically important work. The explanation should be no more than 3 paragraphs.\nA response from Bard could be:\nAsk Follow-Up Questions\nThe \nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nAre there similar stories from other places worldwide?\nA response from Bard could be:\n\n\u2605\n+1",
