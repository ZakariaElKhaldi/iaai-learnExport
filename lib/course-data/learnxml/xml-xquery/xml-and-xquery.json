If you have already studied XPath you will have no problems with \nunderstanding XQuery.\nXQuery - Examples of Use\nXQuery can be used to:\nExtract information to use in a Web Service\nGenerate summary reports\nTransform XML data to XHTML\nSearch Web documents for relevant information\nXQuery is a W3C Recommendation\nXQuery is compatible with several W3C standards, such as XML, Namespaces, \nXSLT, XPath, and XML Schema.\nXQuery 1.0 became a W3C Recommendation in 2007.\nXQuery Tutorial\nYou will learn a lot more about XQuery in our\nXQuery Tutorial\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
