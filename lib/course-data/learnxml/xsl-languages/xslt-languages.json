The meaning of, and how to display each tag is well\nunderstood.\nCSS is used to add styles to HTML elements.\nXSL = Style Sheets for XML\nXML does not use predefined tags, and \ntherefore the meaning of each tag is not well understood.\nA\n<table> element could indicate an HTML table, a piece of furniture, or \nsomething else - and browsers do not know how to\ndisplay it!\nSo, XSL describes how the XML elements should be displayed.\nXSL - More Than a Style Sheet Language\nXSL consists of four parts:\nXSLT - a language for transforming XML documents\nXPath - a language for navigating in XML documents\nXSL-FO - a language for formatting XML documents (discontinued in 2013)\nXQuery - a language for querying XML documents\nWith the\nCSS3 Paged Media Module\n, W3C has delivered a new standard for document \nformatting. So, since 2013, CSS3 is proposed as an XSL-FO replacement.\nWhat is XSLT?\nXSLT stands for XSL Transformations\nXSLT is the most important part of XSL\nXSLT transforms an XML document into another XML document\nXSLT uses XPath to navigate in XML documents\nXSLT is a W3C Recommendation\nXSLT = XSL Transformations\nXSLT is the most important part of XSL.\nXSLT is used to transform an XML document into another XML document, or another\ntype of document that is recognized by a browser, like HTML and\nXHTML. Normally XSLT does this by transforming each XML element into an (X)HTML\nelement.\nWith XSLT you can add/remove elements and attributes to or from the output file. \nYou can also rearrange and sort elements, perform tests and make decisions\nabout which elements to hide and display, and a lot more.\nA common way to describe the transformation process is to say that\nXSLT transforms an XML source-tree into an XML result-tree\n.\nXSLT Uses XPath\nXSLT uses XPath to find information in an XML document. XPath is used to \nnavigate through elements and attributes in XML documents.\nIf you want to study XPath first, please read our\nXPath Tutorial\n.\nHow Does it Work?\nIn the transformation process, XSLT uses XPath to define parts of the source\ndocument that should match one or more predefined templates. When a match is found,\nXSLT will transform the matching part of the source document into the result\ndocument.\nXSLT Browser Support\nAll major browsers support XSLT and XPath.\nXSLT is a W3C Recommendation\nXSLT became a\nW3C Recommendation 16. November 1999\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
