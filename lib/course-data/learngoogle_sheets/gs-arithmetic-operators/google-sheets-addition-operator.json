Either by using the\n+\nsymbol in a formula or by using the\nSUM\nfunction.\nHow to add cell values:\nSelect a cell and type (\n=\n)\nSelect a cell\nType (\n+\n)\nSelect another cell\nHit enter\nYou can add more cells to the formula by typing (+) between the cells.\nLet's have a look at some examples.\nAdding Two Manual Entries\nType\nA1(=)\nType\n5+5\nHit enter\nCongratulations!\nYou have successfully added\n5+5=10\n.\nAdding Two Cells\nFirst let's add some numbers to work with. Type the following values:\nHow to do it, step by step:\nType\nB1(=)\nSelect\nA1\nType (\n+\n)\nSelect\nA2\nHit enter\nGreat!\n30\nis the result by adding\nA1\nand\nA2\n.\nAdding Several Cells\nFirst let's  add some numbers to work with. Type the following values:\n10\n      20\n      20\n      30\n      20\nCopy Values\nStep by step to add several cells:\nType\nB1(=)\nSelect\nA1\nType (\n+\n)\nSelect\nA2\nType (\n+\n)\nSelect\nA3\nType (\n+\n)\nSelect\nA4\nType (\n+\n)\nSelect\nA5\nHit enter\nGood job!\nYou have successfully added five cells!\nAdding with SUM\nLet's keep the numbers from the last exercise. If you did last exercise, remove the value in\nB1\n.\n10\n      20\n      20\n      30\n      20\nCopy Values\nStep by step to add with SUM:\nType\nB1(=SUM)\nClick the\nSUM\ncommand\nMark the range\nA1:A5\nHit enter\nNote:\nSUM\nsaves you time! Keep practicing this function.\nAdding Using Absolute Reference\nYou can also lock a cell and add it to other cells.\nHow to do it, step by step:\nSelect a cell and type (\n=\n)\nSelect the cell you want to lock, add two dollar signs (\n$\n) before the column and row or press\nF4\nType (\n+\n)\nFill a range\nLet's have a look at an example where we add\nB1(5)\nto the range\nA1:A10\nusing\nabsolute reference\nand the\nfill function\n.\nCopy the values:\nAdding with SUM\nLet's keep the numbers from the last exercise.
