See the\nFormat colors chapter\nfor a detailed guide of how to customize colors.\nCustom Min/Mid/Max Points\nThe color scale will apply relative to the chosen min/mid/max points.\nThe default option is\nMin/Max value\n:\nWith the Min/Max value option, google sheets will choose the min and max points based on the largest and smallest values in the selected range.\nThe other options are:\nNumber\nPercent\nPercentile\nThese options will let you specify precisely what the min, mid, and max points should be.\nColor Scale Formatting Example (Min/Max Values)\nHighlight the Speed values of each Pokemon with\nColor scale\nconditional formatting.\nName\tType 1\tSpeed\n        Bulbasaur\tGrass\t45\n        Ivysaur\tGrass\t60\n        Venusaur\tGrass\t80\n        Charmander\tFire\t65\n        Charmeleon\tFire\t80\n        Charizard\tFire\t100\n        Squirtle\tWater\t43\n        Wartortle\tWater\t58\n        Blastoise\tWater\t78\nCopy Values\nConditional formatting, step by step:\nSelect the range of Speed values\nC2:C10\nClick on the\nConditional Formatting\noption in the\nFormat\nmenu\nThe Conditional Formatting menu will appear in the right-hand side of the spreadsheet:\nSelect the\nColor Scales\noption\nThere are 9 default color scale options to choose from.\nThe color at the right-hand side of the icons\nwill apply to the highest values by default.\nClick on the Preview scale \"Choose Default Format\"\nSelect the \"White to green\" Color scale\nNow, the Speed value cells will have a colored background highlighting:\nDark green is used for the highest values, and white for the lowest values.\nCharizard has the highest Speed value (100) and Squirtle has the lowest Speed value (43).\nAll the cells in the range gradually change color from dark green, to ligher greens and then to white.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
