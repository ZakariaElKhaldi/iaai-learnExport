      "content": "Ranges\nRange is an important part of Google Sheets because it allows you to work with selections of cells.\nThere are four different operations for selection;\nSelecting a cell\nSelecting multiple cells\nSelecting a column\nSelecting a row\nBefore having a look at the different operations for selection, we will introduce the Name Box.\nThe Name Box\nThe Name Box shows you the reference of which cell or range you have selected. It can also be used to select cells or ranges by typing their coordinates.\nYou will learn more about the Name Box later in this chapter.\nSelecting a Cell\nCells are selected by clicking them with the left mouse button or by navigating to them with the keyboard arrows.\nIt is easiest to use the mouse to select cells.\nTo select cell\nA1\n, click on it:\nSelecting Multiple Cells\nMore than one cell can be selected by pressing and holding down\nCtrl\nor\nCommand\nand left clicking the cells. Once finished with selecting, you can let go of\nCtrl\nor\nCommand\n.\nLets try an example: Select the cells\nA1\n,\nA7\n,\nC1\n,\nC7\nand\nB4\n.\nDid it look like the picture below?\nSelecting a Column\nColumns are selected by left clicking on them. This will select\nall\ncells in the sheet related to the column.\nTo select\ncolumn A\n, click on the letter A in the column bar:\nSelecting a Row\nRows are selected by left clicking on them. This will select all the cells in the sheet related to that row.\nTo select\nrow 1\n, click on its number in the row bar:\nSelecting the Entire Sheet\nThe entire spreadsheet can be selected by clicking on the rectangle in the top-left corner of the spreadsheet:\nNow, the whole spreadsheet is selected:\nNote:\nYou can also select the entire spreadsheet by pressing\nCtrl+A\nfor Windows, or\nCommand+A\nfor MacOS.\nSelection of Ranges\nSelection of cell ranges has many use areas and it is one of the most important concepts of Google Sheets. Do not think too much about how it is used with values. You will learn about this in a later chapter. For now let's focus on how to select ranges.\nThere are three ways to select a range of cells\nName Box\nDrag to mark a range.\nUsing the Shift key.\nThe\nfirst\nand the easiest way is drag and mark. Let's keep it simple and start there.\nHow to drag and mark a range, step-by-step:\nSelect a cell\nLeft click it and hold the mouse button down\nMove your mouse pointer over the range that you want selected. The range that is marked will turn grey.\nLet go of the mouse button when you have marked the range\nLet's have a look at an example for how to mark the range\nA1:D10\n.\nNote:\nYou will learn about why the range is called\nA1:D10\nafter this example.\nSelect cell\nA1\n:\nPress and hold\nA1\nwith the left mouse button. Move to the mouse pointer to mark the selection range. The light blue area helps us to see the covered range.\nLet go of the left mouse button when you have marked the range\nA1:D10\n:\nYou have successfully selected the range\nA1:D10\n.\nWell done!\nThe\nsecond\nway to select a range is to enter the range values in the Name Box. The range is set by first entering the cell reference for the top left corner, then the bottom right corner. The range is made using those two as coordinates. That is why the cell range has the reference of two cells and the\n:\nin between.\nTop left corner reference : Right bottom corner reference\nThe range shown in the picture has the value of\nA1:D10\n:\nThe\nthird\nway to select a range is by holding the\nShift\nkey on the keyboard and selecting the reference cells for the range.\nLets try an example: Select all the cells  from\nB2:C3\n.\nHold down the\nShift\nkey and select\nB2\nWhile holding the\nShift\nkey, select\nC3\nGood job!\nThe best way for now is to use the drag and mark method as it is easier and more visual.\nIn the\n\n\u2605\n+1",
