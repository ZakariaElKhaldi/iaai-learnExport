      "content": "Sort Range By Column\nGoogle sheet lets you sort data in a range by columns\nIt is possible to sort data in a sheet by range.\nNote:\nTo sort a range that has more than one column, the whole range of data has to be selected. Sorting just one can breaks the relationship between columns.\nThis is shown in an example later in this chapter.\nThe sort commands can be found in the\nData\nmenu.\nExample (Sort Text)\nSort the Pokemon in the range\nA2:A21\nby their\nName\n, ascending from smallest to largest (A-Z).\nCopy the values to follow along.\nName\n      Bulbasaur\n      Ivysaur\n      Venusaur\n      Charmander\n      Charmeleon\n      Charizard\n      Squirtle\n      Wartortle\n      Blastoise\n      Caterpie\n      Metapod\n      Butterfree\n      Weedle\n      Kakuna\n      Beedrill\n      Pidgey\n      Pidgeotto\n      Pidgeotto\n      Rattata\n      Raticate\nCopy Values\nSelect the range\nA2:A21\nNote:\nA1\nis not included as it is the header for the column. This is the row that is dedicated to the filter. Including it will blend it with the rest.\nClick on the\nData\nmenu and select\nSort range by column A, A \u2192 Z\nThis is the result:\nTry again, this time with\nSort range by column A, Z \u2192 A\nto see what that looks like!\nExample (Sort Numbers)\nSort the Pokemon ascending by their\nTotal stats\nfrom smallest to largest.\nCopy the values to follow along.\nTotal stats\n      318\n      405\n      525\n      309\n      405\n      534\n      314\n      405\n      530\n      195\n      205\n      395\n      195\n      205\n      395\n      251\n      349\n      479\n      253\n      413\nCopy Values\nSelect the range\nA2:A21\nClick on the\nData\nmenu and select\nSort range by column A, A \u2192 Z\nThis is the result:\nGreat!\nThe Pokemon were successfully sorted by their\nTotal stats\nfrom smallest to largest. The sort commands work for both text and numbers.\nA Non-Working Example (Sorting One Column In A Range)\nThis example shows how sorting column by range can break the relationship between multiple data columns.\nIn this example we have two columns with related data. Column\nA\nis the Pokemon\nNames\nand Column\nB\nis their\nTotal stats\n. Try sorting just one of the columns (\nA2:A21\n) ascending by their\nNames\n.\nCopy the values to follow along.\nName\tTotal stats\n      Bulbasaur\t318\n      Ivysaur\t405\n      Venusaur\t525\n      Charmander\t309\n      Charmeleon\t405\n      Charizard\t534\n      Squirtle\t314\n      Wartortle\t405\n      Blastoise\t530\n      Caterpie\t195\n      Metapod\t205\n      Butterfree\t395\n      Weedle\t195\n      Kakuna\t205\n      Beedrill\t395\n      Pidgey\t251\n      Pidgeotto\t349\n      Pidgeotto\t479\n      Rattata\t253\n      Raticate\t413\nCopy Values\nSelect the range\nA2:A21\nClick on the\nData\nmenu and select\nSort range by column A, A \u2192 Z\nThis is the result:\nThe image above shows that the relationship between column\nA\nand\nB\nis broken. The Pokemon now have wrong Total stats.\nSorting More Than One Column\nSelect the whole range when sorting ranges with more than one column.\nWhen sorting multiple columns, the sorting is done based on the column with\ncell\nhaving the blue rectangle. This is the cell that you start selecting your range with.\nIn the image below the sorting is done based on the\nName\nvalues in column\nA\nIn the image below the sorting is done based on the\nTotal stats\nvalues in column\nB\nExample\nThis example shows how to sort data without losing the relationship between the data columns.\nSort the Pokemon based on their names in ascending order.\nCopy the values to follow along.\nName\tTotal stats\n      Bulbasaur\t318\n      Ivysaur\t405\n      Venusaur\t525\n      Charmander\t309\n      Charmeleon\t405\n      Charizard\t534\n      Squirtle\t314\n      Wartortle\t405\n      Blastoise\t530\n      Caterpie\t195\n      Metapod\t205\n      Butterfree\t395\n      Weedle\t195\n      Kakuna\t205\n      Beedrill\t395\n      Pidgey\t251\n      Pidgeotto\t349\n      Pidgeotto\t479\n      Rattata\t253\n      Raticate\t413\nCopy Values\nSelect the range\nA2:B21\nClick on the\nData\nmenu and select\nSort range by column A, A \u2192 Z\nThis is the result:\nBy selecting range\nA2:B21\nthe sort is done correctly, keeping the relationship between the data (Column\nA\nand\nB\n).\nNow try to sort Pokemon based on their total stats in a descending order.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
