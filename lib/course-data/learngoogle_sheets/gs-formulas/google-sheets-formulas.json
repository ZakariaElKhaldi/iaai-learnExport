      "content": "Formulas\nA formula in Google Sheets is used to do mathematical calculations. Formulas always start with the equal sign (\n=\n) typed in the cell, followed by your calculation.\nFormulas can be used for calculations such as:\n=1+1\n=2*2\n=4/2=2\nformulas can take cells as input.\nLet's have a look at an example.\nType or copy the following values:\n2\n      4\nCopy Values\nNow we want to do a calculation with those values.\nStep by step:\nSelect\nC1\nand type (\n=\n)\nSelect\nA1\nType (\n+\n)\nSelect\nA2\nPress enter\nYou got it!\nYou have successfully calculated\nA1(2) + A2(4) = C1(6)\n.\nNote:\nUsing cells to make calculations is an important part of Google Sheets and you will use this a lot as you learn.\nLets change from addition to multiplication, by replacing the (\n+\n) with a (\n*\n). It should now be\n=A1*A2\n, press enter to see what happens.\nYou got\nC1(8)\n, right?\nWell done!\nGoogle Sheets is great in this way. It allows you to add values to cells and do calculations on them.\nNow, try to change the multiplication (\n*\n) to subtraction (\n-\n) and dividing (\n/\n).\nDelete all values in the sheet after you have tried the different combinations.\nLet's add new data for the \nType or copy the following values:\nTrainers\tPokeball\tGreat Balls\tUltra Balls\n      Iva\t2\t3\t1\n      Liam\t5\t5\t2\n      Adora\t10\t2\t3\nCopy Values\nThe data explained:\nColumn\nA\n: Pokemon Trainers\nRow\n1\n: Types of Pokeballs\nRange\nB2:D4\n: Amount of Pokeballs, Great balls and Ultra balls\nNote:\nIt is important to practice reading data to understand its context. In this example you should focus on the trainers and their Pokeballs, which have three different types: Pokeball, Great ball and Ultra ball.\nLet's help Iva to count her Pokeballs. You find Iva in\nA2(Iva)\n. The values in\nrow 2 B2(2), C2(3), D2(1)\nbelong to her.\nCount the Pokeballs, step by step:\nSelect cell\nE2\nand type (\n=\n)\nSelect\nB2\nType (\n+\n)\nSelect\nC2\nType (\n+\n)\nSelect\nD2\nHit enter\nDid you get the value\nE2(6)\n?\nGood job!\nYou have helped Iva to count her Pokeballs.\nNow, let's help Liam and Adora with counting theirs.\nDo you remember the\nfill function\nthat we learned about earlier? It can be used to continue calculations sidewards, downwards and upwards. Let's try it!\nLets use the fill function to continue the formula, step by step:\nSelect\nE2\nFill\nE2:E4\nThat is cool, right?\nThe fill function continued the calculation that you used for Iva and was able to understand that you wanted to count the cells in the \nNow we have counted the Pokeballs for all the trainers; Iva(\n6\n), Liam(\n12\n) and Adora(\n15\n).\nLet's see how many Pokeballs Iva, Liam and Adora have in total.\nThe total is called\nSUM\nin Google Sheets.\nThere are two ways to calculate the\nSUM\n.\nAdding cells\nSUM function\nGoogle Sheets has many pre-made functions available for you to use. The\nSUM\nfunction is one of the most used ones. You will learn more about functions in a later chapter.\nLet's try both approaches.\nNote:\nYou can navigate to the cells with your keyboard arrows instead of right clicking them. Try it!\nSum by adding cells, step by step:\nSelect cell E5, and type\n=\nSelect\nE2\nType (\n+\n)\nSelect\nE3\nType (\n+\n)\nSelect\nE4\nHit enter\nThe result is\nE5(33)\n.\nLet's try the\nSUM\nfunction.\nRemember to delete the values that you currently have in\nE5\n.\nSUM\nfunction, step by step:\nType\nE5(=)\nWrite\nSUM\nDouble click\nSUM\nin the menu\nMark the range\nE2:E4\nHit enter\nGreat job!\nYou have successfully calculated the\nSUM\nusing the\nSUM\nfunction.\nIva, Liam and Adora have\n33\nPokeballs in total.\nLet's change a value to see what happens. Type\nB2(7)\n:\nThe value in cell\nB2\nwas changed from\n2\nto\n7\n. Notice that the formulas are doing calculations when we change the value in the cells, and the\nSUM\nis updated from\n33\nto\n38\n. It allows us to change values that are used by the formulas, and the calculations remain.\nChapter Summary\nValues used in formulas can be typed directly and by using cells. The formula updates the result if you change the value of cells, which is used in the formula. The fill function can be used to continue your formulas upwards, downwards and sidewards. Google Sheets has pre-built functions, such as\nSUM\n.\nIn the\n\n\u2605\n+1",
