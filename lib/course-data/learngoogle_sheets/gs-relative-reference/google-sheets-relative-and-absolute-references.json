      "content": "Relative and Absolute References\nCells in Google Sheets have unique references, which is their location.\nReferences are used in formulas to do calculations, and the fill function can be used to continue formulas sidewards, downwards and upwards.\nGoogle Sheets have two types of references:\nRelative references\nAbsolute references\nAbsolute reference is a choice we make. It is a command which tells Google Sheets to lock a reference.\nThe dollar sign (\n$\n) is used to make references absolute.\nExample of relative reference:\nA1\nExample of absolute reference:\n$A$1\nRelative reference\nReferences are relative by default, and are without dollar sign (\n$\n).\nThe relative reference makes the cells reference free. It gives the fill function freedom to continue the order without restrictions.\nLet's have a look at a relative reference example, helping the Pokemon trainers to count their Pokeballs (\nB2:B7\n) and Great balls (\nC2:C7\n).\nTrainers\tPokeballs\tGreat balls\n      Iva\t2\t3\n      Liam\t5\t5\n      Pablo\t10\t2\n      Jenny\t7\t1\n      Iben\t6\t2\n      Kasper\t3\t4\nCopy Values\nThe result is:\nD2(5)\n:\n\nD2:D7\n:\nThe references being relative allows the fill function to continue the formula for rows downwards.\nHave a look at the formulas in\nD2:D7\n. You can do this by clicking ion the\nview\nmenu and choosing\nShow formulas\n.\nNotice that Google Sheets calculates the \nA Non-Working Example\nLet's try an example\nthat will not work\n.\nFill\nD2:G2\n, filling to the\nright\ninstead of downwards. Resulting in strange numbers:\nHave a look at the formulas.\nIt assumes that we are calculating sidewards and not downwards.\nThe numbers that we want to calculate need to be in the same direction as we fill.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
