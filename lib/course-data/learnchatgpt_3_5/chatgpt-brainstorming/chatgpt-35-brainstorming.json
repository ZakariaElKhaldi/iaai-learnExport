      "content": "Using ChatGPT-3.5 to Brainstorm\nChatGPT can't replace your creativity, but you can use it to give yourself new ideas and perspectives.\nYou can use ChatGPT as someone who is always ready to brainstorm and can brainstorm just about anything!\nDefine the Topic\nBefore using Generative AI to help you, you should clarify the topic.\nAre you starting a new business? Finding a name for a cat? In this example, we will brainstorm ideas for activities for a birthday party for five-year-old girls.\nAsk Open-Ended Questions\nUnlike when you ask ChatGPT for something specific, it is important to keep it open-ended for brainstorming sessions. This will give you a wider range of responses:\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nWhat are some unique ideas for activities for 10 five-year-old girls at a birthday party?\nA response from ChatGPT-3.5 could be:\nThat is a good list of starting points. Let's narrow it down, then expand it further.\nFollow-Ups with more Details\nFrom the list above, let's move forward with ideas 4 and 6. Maybe combine them into one for an outdoor Olympic game and scavenger hunt.\nTo get more details, we can ask ChatGPT to add unique details:\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nHow can we combine ideas 4 and 6? How can we make this into a unique experience that the children will remember?\nA response from ChatGPT-3.5 could be:\nA good idea, but we can improve it further. This gives me an idea!\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nHow can we make this more social for the girl? I am worried they will lose interest going off one by one, making it more difficult to organize. Let's add something to keep it fun. If we look at this with a Zombie Princess theme, how can we make it more of a thing they do together? Maybe starting as 2 teams, Zombies and Princesses. But the zombies can \"infect\" the princesses. How would that work within the Nature Olympics?\nA response from ChatGPT-3.5 could be:\nNow that sounds like a good time!\nRefine Further\nNow we have our key idea, let's define it further.\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nLet's set this up with the following premise: The Zombies start as a team of 2 but will gradually \"infect\" the princesses and ideally will have infected all of them by the last part.\nHow can we reorganize and add to the activities to accomplish that? Everyone must be included, and I think we should have the \"Zombie transformation station\" between each event to transform the princesses.\nA response from ChatGPT-3.5 could be:\nThat was an example of how you can start with a basic idea and, with the help of ChatGPT, transform it into something unique.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
