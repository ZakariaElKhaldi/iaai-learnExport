      "content": "Using ChatGPT-3.5 to Write Emails\nYou can use ChatGPT to help you write different types of emails.\nUse ChatGPT as an assistant, helping you put the right tone and format for your message.\nDefine the Goal of Your Email\nTo help you write an email, ChatGPT needs context. What is the goal of your email?\nExamples:\nIntroduction to a potential client\nAsking for a meeting\nJob application\nCompany announcement\nFormal request\nFormal complaint\nResponse to a complaint\nWe will go through each of these with examples, and by the end of this page, you should have a good idea of how to use ChatGPT to write any email you need.\nEmail - Introduction to Potential Client\nIn this example, we want to showcase our services\n Spaces\n, to a school with a web development course.\nThe school is called \"Nowhere High\", and the web development teacher is responsible for the curriculum and purchases for this course. Her name is \"Nott Bernatto\".\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nWrite a professional email introducing our services to a potential client. The product is detailed here: \"https://www..com/spaces/\". The client's name is \"Nott Bernatto\", and she is in charge of the web development course on \"Nothing High\", a high school in New York.\nA response from ChatGPT-3.5 could be:\nNow, you can continue to refine this draft and make it your own. But ChatGPT gave us a good starting point.\nEmail - Asking for a Meeting\nIn this example, we have made initial contact with \"Nott Bernatto\" from the example above, and we are trying to set up a meeting via Google Hangouts.\nWe are typically available for an hour at 16:00 GMT on Mondays and Thursdays but are flexible if that does not work for the client.\nWe want to discuss the possible plans available and answer any technical questions they might have.\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nWrite a professional email requesting a meeting for a discussion about using the product \" Spaces\" (detailed here \"https://www..com/spaces/\" ). The client has expressed interest and wants to know more about the product. The subject of the meeting is going through technical details and available plans. The client's name is \"Nott Bernatto\", and she is in charge of the web development course at \"Nothing High\", a high school in New York. We are typically available for an hour at 16:00 GMT on Mondays and Thursdays via Zoom or Google Hangouts but are flexible if that does not work for the client.\nA response from ChatGPT-3.5 could be:\nEmail - Job Application\nIn this example, we want to apply for a job at .com.\nWe will attach our CV to this email.\nWe saw a Linkedin post asking for developers. We have had 2 years of experience as a junior programmer and are very familiar with .com.\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nWrite a professional email responding to a Linkedin post asking for developers at .com. I have 2 years of working experience as a junior developer and am very familiar with the company. My CV will be attached to this email.\nA response from ChatGPT-3.5 could be:\nEmail - Company Annoncement\nIn this example, we announce that \"Nott Bernatto\" has been hired by our company, .com, as a Junior Developer.\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nWrite a professional email introducing \"Nott Bernatto\" as a newly hired Junior Developer at .com.\nA response from ChatGPT-3.5 could be:\nEmail - Formal Request\nIn this example, we want to ask for the day off on the 17th of May to celebrate Norway's national day.\nWe understand this is not usually a day off in the USA, but we want to respect our Norwegian heritage with our family.\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nWrite a professional email requesting the day of the 17th of May? This is Norway's national day, and though we understand that this is not usually a day off in the USA, we want to respect our Norwegian heritage with our family.\nA response from ChatGPT-3.5 could be:\nEmail - Formal Complaint\nIn this example, we want to complain about the lack of parking spaces around our office building.\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nWrite a professional email complaining about the lack of parking spaces around our office building\nA response from ChatGPT-3.5 could be:\nEmail - Response to a Complaint\nIn this example, we respond to the complaint above that though the parking situation could be better, it is the best we can do with the current regulations.\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nRespond to the complaint above that though the parking situation is less than ideal, it is the best we can do with the current regulations.\nA response from ChatGPT-3.5 could be:\n\n\u2605\n+1",
