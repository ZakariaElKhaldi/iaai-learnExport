Analyzing data and predicting the outcome!\nIn Machine Learning it is common to work with very large data sets. In this \n  tutorial we will try to make it as easy as possible to understand the \n  different concepts of machine learning, and we will work with small \n  easy-to-understand data sets.\nData Types\nTo analyze data, it is important to know what type of data we are dealing with.\nWe can split the data types into three main categories:\nNumerical\nCategorical\nOrdinal\nNumerical\ndata are numbers, and can be split into two \nnumerical categories:",

Example: school grades where A is better than B and so \non.\nBy knowing the data type of your data source, you will be able to know what \ntechnique to use when analyzing them.\nYou will learn more about statistics and analyzing data in the \n\n\u2605\n+1",
