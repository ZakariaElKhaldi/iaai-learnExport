Opens a \nfile for reading, error if the file does not exist\n\"a\"\n- Append - Opens a file for \nappending, creates the file if it does not exist\n\"w\"\n- Write - Opens a file for writing, \ncreates the file if it does not exist\n\"x\"\n- Create - Creates the specified file, returns \nan error if the file exists\nIn addition you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode\n\"t\"\n- Text - Default value. Text mode\n\"b\"\n- Binary - Binary mode (e.g. \n  images)\nSyntax\nTo open a file for reading it is enough to specify the name of the file:\nf = open(\"demofile.txt\")\nThe code above is the same as:\nf = open(\"demofile.txt\", \"rt\")\nBecause\n\"r\"\nfor read, and\n\"t\"\nfor text are the default values, you do not need to specify them.\nNote:\nMake sure the file exists, or else you will get an error.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
