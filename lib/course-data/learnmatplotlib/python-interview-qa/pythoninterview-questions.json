      "content": "This page contains a list of typical Python Interview Questions and Answers.\nPython Interview Questions\nThese questions and answers cover some fundamental Python concepts that are often discussed in interviews.\n1) What is the difference between global and local scope?\nA variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function, and can only be used inside that function.\nA variable created in the main body of the Python code is a global variable and belongs to the global scope. Global variables are available from within any scope, global and local.\n2) What is an iterator in Python?\nAn iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.\nAn iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values.\nTechnically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods __iter__() and __\n3) What is the __init__() function in Python?\nAll classes in Python have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.\nWe can use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created.\n4) When should you use lambda functions in Python?\nUse lambda functions when an anonymous function is required for a short period of time.\n5) What is the difference between lists, tuples and sets?\nLists, tuples and sets are all used to store multiple items in a single variable.\nA list is a collection of data which is ordered and changeable (elements can be added, removed and changed).\nA tuple is a collection of data which is ordered and unchangeable (elements cannot be added, removed or changed).\nA set is a collection of data which is unordered, unchangeable, and unindexed.\n6) How can you check if all the characters in a string are alphanumeric?\nYou can use the\nisalnum()\nmethod, which returns True if all the characters are alphanumeric, meaning alphabet letter (a-z) and numbers (0-9).\n7) How can you convert a string to an integer?\nYou can use the\nint()\nfunction, like this:\nnum = \"5\"\nconvert = int(num)\n8) What is indentation in Python, and why is it important?\nIndentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.\nPython uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\nPython will give you an error if you skip the indentation.\n9) What is the correct syntax to output the type of a variable or object in Python?\nprint(type(x))\n10) Which collection does not allow duplicate members?\nSET\n11) What is Inheritance in Python?\nInheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.\nParent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.\nChild class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.\n12) What is the output of the following code?\nx = 41\n\nif x > 10:\n  print(\"Above ten,\")\n  if x > 20:\n    print(\"and also above 20!\")\n  else:\n    print(\"but not above 20.\")\nAbove ten,\nand also above 20!\n13) Can you list Python's primary built-in data types, in categories?\nText Type:\nstr\nNumeric Types:\nint\n,\nfloat\n,\ncomplex\nSequence Types:\nlist\n,\ntuple\n,\nrange\nMapping Type:\ndict\nSet Types:\nset\n,\nfrozenset\nBoolean Type:\nbool\nBinary Types:\nbytes\n,\nbytearray\n,\nmemoryview\n14) What are Membership Operators?\nMembership operators are used to test if a sequence is present in an object. The\nin\nand\nnot in\noperators are examples of these:\nx = [\"apple\", \"banana\"]\nprint(\"banana\" in x) # returns True\nx = [\"apple\", \"banana\"]\nprint(\"pineapple\" not in x) # returns True\n15) Which\nstatement\ncan be used to avoid errors if an\nif\nstatement has no content?\nThe\npass\nstatement\n16) What are Arbitrary Arguments?\nArbitrary Arguments are often shortened to\n*args\nin Python documentations.\nIf you do not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function, add a\n*\nbefore the parameter name in the function definition. This way the function will receive a tuple of arguments, and can access the items accordingly.\n17) How can you create and use a Module in Python??\nTo create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension\n.py\n:\ndef greeting(name):\nprint(\"Hello, \" + name)\nNow we can use the module we just created, by using the\nimport\nstatement:\nimport mymodule\nmymodule.greeting(\"Jonathan\")\n18) Can you copy a List in Python by simply writing:\nlist2 = \nlist1\n?\nNo, because:\nlist2\nwill only be a\nreference\nto\nlist1\n, and changes made in\nlist1\nwill automatically also be made in\nlist2\n.\nTo make a copy of a list, you can use\ncopy()\nor the\nlist()\nmethod.\n19) How can you return a range of characters of a string?\nYou can return a range of characters by using the \"slice syntax\".\nSpecify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string, for example:\nGet the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included):\nb = \"Hello, World!\"\nprint(b[2:5])\n20) What is a class in Python, and how do you use it?\nA Class is like an object constructor, or a \"blueprint\" for creating objects.\nYou can create a class with the class keyword:\nclass MyClass:\nx = 5\nNow we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:\nCreate an object named p1, and print the value of x:\np1 = MyClass()\nprint(p1.x)\nKickstart your career\nGet certified by completing\nthe\ncourse\nGet certified\nw\n3\ns\nc\nh\no\no\nl\ns\nC\nE\nR\nT\nI\nF\nI\nE\nD\n.\n2\n0\n2\n5\n\n\u2605\n+1",
