      "content": "What is Standard Deviation?\nStandard deviation is a number that describes how spread out the values are.\nA low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value.\nA high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range.\nExample: This time we have registered the speed of 7 cars:\nspeed = [86,87,88,86,87,85,86]\nThe standard deviation is:\n0.9\nMeaning that most of the values are within the range of 0.9 from the mean \nvalue, which is 86.4.\nLet us do the same with a selection of numbers with a wider range:\nspeed = [32,111,138,28,59,77,97]\nThe standard deviation is:\n37.85\nMeaning that most of the values are within the range of 37.85 from the mean \nvalue, which is 77.4.\nAs you can see, a higher standard deviation indicates that the values are \nspread out over a wider range.\nThe NumPy module has a method to calculate the standard deviation:\nExample\nUse the NumPy\nstd()\nmethod to find the \nstandard deviation:\nimport numpy\nspeed = [86,87,88,86,87,85,86]\nx = numpy.std(speed)\nprint(x)\n\nExample\nimport numpy\nspeed = [32,111,138,28,59,77,97]\nx = numpy.std(speed)\nprint(x)\n\nLearn to Filter Data in Python Like a Data Analyst\nTry a hands-on training sessions with step-by-step guidance from an expert. Try the guided project made in collaboration with Coursera now!\nGet started\nVariance\nVariance is another number that indicates how spread out the values are.\nIn fact, if you take the square root of the variance, you get the standard \ndeviation!\nOr the other way around, if you multiply the standard deviation by itself, you get the \nvariance!\nTo calculate the variance you have to do as follows:\n1. Find the mean:\n(32+111+138+28+59+77+97) / 7 = 77.4\n2. For each value: find the difference from the mean:\n32 - 77.4 = -45.4\n111 - 77.4 =\u00a0 33.6\n138 \n  - 77.4 =\u00a0 60.6\n28 - 77.4 = -49.4\n59 - 77.4 = -18.4\n77 \n  - 77.4 = - 0.4\n97 - 77.4 =\u00a0 19.6\n3. For each difference: find the square value:\n(-45.4)\n2\n= 2061.16\n(33.6)\n2\n= 1128.96\n(60.6)\n2\n= 3672.36\n(-49.4)\n2\n= 2440.36\n(-18.4)\n2\n=\u00a0 338.56\n(-\u00a00.4)\n2\n=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0.16\n(19.6)\n2\n=\u00a0 384.16\n4. The variance is the average number of these squared differences:\n(2061.16+1128.96+3672.36+2440.36+338.56+0.16+384.16) \n  / 7 = 1432.2\nLuckily, NumPy has a method to calculate the variance:\nExample\nUse the NumPy\nvar()\nmethod to find the variance:\nimport numpy\nspeed = [32,111,138,28,59,77,97]\nx = numpy.var(speed)\nprint(x)\n\nStandard Deviation\nAs we have learned, the formula to find the standard deviation is the square root of the variance:\n\u221a\n1432.25 = 37.85\nOr, as in the example from before, use the NumPy to calculate the standard deviation:\nExample\nUse the NumPy\nstd()\nmethod to find the standard deviation:\nimport numpy\nspeed = [32,111,138,28,59,77,97]\nx = numpy.std(speed)\nprint(x)\n\nSymbols\nStandard Deviation is often represented by the symbol Sigma:\n\u03c3\nVariance is often represented by the symbol Sigma Squared:\n\u03c3\n2\nChapter Summary\nThe Standard Deviation and Variance are terms that are often used in Machine Learning, so it is important to understand how to get them, and the concept behind them.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
