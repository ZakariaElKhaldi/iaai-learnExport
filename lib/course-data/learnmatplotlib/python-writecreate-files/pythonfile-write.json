I have deleted the content!\")\n#open and read the file after the overwriting:\nwith open(\"demofile.txt\") \n  as f:\nprint(f.read())\nRun Example \u00bb\nNote:\nthe \"w\" method will overwrite the entire file.\nCreate a New File\nTo create a new file in Python, use the\nopen()\nmethod, \nwith one of the following parameters:\n\"x\"\n- Create - will create a file, returns \nan error if the file exists\n\"a\"\n- Append - will create a file if the \nspecified file does not exists\n\"w\"\n- Write - will create a file if the \nspecified file does not exists\nExample\nCreate a new file called \"myfile.txt\":\nf = open(\"myfile.txt\", \"x\")\nRun Example \u00bb\nResult: a new empty file is created.\nNote:\nIf the file already exist, an error will be raised.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
