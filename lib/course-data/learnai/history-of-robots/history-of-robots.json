It will continue to the same job until you turn it off.\nRobotic Bartenders on Quantum of the Seas - Royal Caribbean:\nRobots and Artificial Intelligence are two different things.\nRobot technology is not a subset of Artificial Intelligence.\nA robot is a physical thing. After 50 years of development, almost anything is programmable,\nyour radio, your watch, your phone, and even robots.\nAI Robots\nArtificial Intelligence can be built into robots,\nand AI is a very exciting field in future robotics.\nHanson Robotics' Sophia personifies some dreams for the future of AI.\nSophia is a combination of science, engineering, and artistry.\nShe is a human-crafted science fiction character depicting the future of AI and robotics.\nCan AI Robots Interact Socially?\nYes, AI Robots can learn to interact socially.\nKismet (a MIT robot) is programmed to understand body language and voice inflection.\nThe creators study how human and babies interact, based on tone of speech and visual cue.\nKismet could be the foundation of a human-like learning system.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
