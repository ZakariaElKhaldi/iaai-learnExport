Like \nwhat is the expected price for a house?\nMachine Learning Inference\nInference is when the trained model is used to infer (predict) values using \nlive data. Like putting the model into production.\nMachine Learning Phases\nMachine learning has two main phases:\n1.\nTraining\n:\nInput data are used to calculate the parameters of the model.\n2.\nInference\n:\nThe \"trained\" model outputs correct data from any input.\nSupervised Machine Learning\nUnsupervised Machine Learning\nSelf-Supervised Machine Learning\nSupervised Learning\nSupervised Machine Learning uses a set of input variables to predict the value of an output variable.\nSupervised learning uses\nlabeled data\n(data with known answers) to train\nalgorithms to:\nClassify Data\nPredict Outcomes\nSupervised learning can\nclassify\ndata like \"What is spam in an e-mail\",\nbased on known spam examples.\nSupervised learning can\npredict\noutcomes like predicting what kind of video you like,\nbased on the videos you have played.\nUnsupervised Learning\nUnsupervised Machine Learning uses patterns from any unlabeled dataset,\ntrying to understand patterns (or groupings) in the data.\nUnsupervised learning is used to predict undefined relationships like \nmeaningful patterns in data.\nIt is about creating computer algorithms than can improve themselves.\nIt is expected that machine learning will shift to unsupervised learning \nto allow programmers to solve problems without creating models.\nReinforcement Learning\nReinforcement learning is based on non-supervised learning but receives feedback from the user\nwhether the decision is good or bad. The feedback contributes to improving the model.\nSelf-Supervised Learning\nSelf-supervised learning is similar to unsupervised learning\nbecause it works with data without human added labels.\nThe difference is that unsupervised learning uses clustering, grouping, and dimensionality reduction,\nwhile self-supervised learning draw its own conclusions for regression and classification tasks.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
