It can be used for all types of programming and software development.\nPython is typically used for server development, like building web apps for web servers.\nPython is also typically used in\nData Science\n.\nAn advantage for using Python is that it comes with some very suitable libraries:\nNumPy (Library for working with Arrays)\nSciPy (Library for Statistical Science)\nMatplotlib (Graph Plotting Library)\nNLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)\nTensorFlow (Machine Learning)\nSource: Octoverse\nC++\nC++\nholds the title: \"\nThe worlds fastest programming language\n\".\nBecause of the speed, C++ is a preferred language when programming Computer Games.\nIt provides faster execution and has less response time which is applied in search engines and development of computer games.\nGoogle uses C++ in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning programs for SEO (Search Engine Optimization).\nSHARK\nis a super-fast C++ library with support for supervised learning algorithms, linear regression,\nneural networks, and clustering.\nMLPACK\nis also a super-fast machine learning library for C++.\nJava\nJava\nis another general-purpose coding language that can be used for all types of software development.\nFor Machine Learning, Java is mostly used to create algorithms, and neural networks.\nSQL\nSQL\n(Structured Query Language) is the most popular language for managing data.\nKnowledge of SQL databases, tables and queries helps data scientists when dealing with data.\nSQL is very convenient for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in databases.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
