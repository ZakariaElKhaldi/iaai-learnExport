Why is AI more interesting now?\nThe answer is:\nComputing power has not been strong enough\nComputer storage has not been large enough\nBig data has not been available\nFast Internet has not been available\nAnother strong force is the major investments from big companies\n(Google, Microsoft, Facebook, YouTube) because their datasets became much too big to handle traditionally.\nMan vs Machine\nMan\nComputer\nSmart\nStupid\nSlow\nFast\nInaccurate\nAccurate\nInteresting Questions\nStudying AI raises many interesting questions:\n\"Can computers think like humans?\"\n\"Can computers be smarter than humans?\"\n\"Can computers take over the world?\"\nMachines can understand verbal commands, recognize faces, drive cars, and play games better than us.\nHow long will it take before they walk among us?\nArtificial Intelligence Films\nMetropolis\nGerman Science-Fiction Drama (1927).\nIn the future, wealthy industrialists and business magnates and their top employees reign over the city of Metropolis\nfrom colossal skyscrapers, while underground-dwelling workers toil to operate the great machines that power it.\nRated as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made.\nInscribed in\nUNESCO's Memory of the World Register\nin 2001, as the first film thus distinguished.\nThe Day the Earth Stood Still\nAmerican Science-Fiction (1951).\nRated by the US National Film Registry in 1995 as\nCulturally, Historically, or Aesthetically Significant\n.\n2001:a Space Odyssey\nEpic Science-Fiction (1968).\nSelected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the US Library of Congress in 1991 as\nCulturally, Historically, or Aesthetically Significant\n.\nWestworld\nAmerican Science-Fiction Western (1973).\nAn adult amusement park has 3 worlds populated with androids that are indistinguishable from human beings: Western World (American Old West),\nMedieval World (Medieval Europe), and Roman World (City of Pompeii).\nWestworld is a story about how\nartificial intelligence\ncan be used to entertain us and allow us to live out our fantasies.\nStar Wars\nEpic Space Opera Film (1977).\nWinning 7 Oscars at the 50th Academy Awards (including Best Picture).\nThe Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) rounded the Star Wars trilogy.\nSelected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the US Library of Congress in 1989,\nfor being\nCulturally, Historically, or Aesthetically Significant\n.\n1977\nDemon Seed\n1982\nBlade Runner\n1983\nWarGames\n1984\nThe Terminator\n1985\nD.A.R.Y.\nScience-Fiction film.\nDARYL (\"Data-Analyzing Robot Youth Lifeform\") is an artificial intelligence experiment created by the government.\n1986\nShort Circuit\n1987\nRoboCop\n1994\nStar Trek\n1999\nBicentennial Man\nThe Matrix\nScience-Fiction Action (1999).\nSelected for preservation in the US National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 2012, for being\nCulturally, Historically, or Aesthetically Significant\n.\n2001\nA.I.
