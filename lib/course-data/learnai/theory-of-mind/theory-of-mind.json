What is the future?\nYear 2000:\nReactive Machines\nYear 2015:\nMachine Learning\nYear 2030:\nTheory of Mind\nYear 2050:\nSelf-Awareness\nReactive Machines\nEarly AI systems were reactive. Reactive systems cannot use past experience.\nIn 1997 a reactive machine (\"IBM Deep Blue\") beat the world champion in chess.\n\"Deep Blue\" could not think. But it was stored with information about the chess board,\nand the rules for moving chess pieces.\n\"Deep Blue\" won because it was programmed to calculate every move to win.\nMachine Learning\nToday, AI systems can use some information from the past.\nOne example is self-driven cars. They can combine pre-programmed information with\ninformation they collect while they learn how to drive.\nTheory of Mind\nTheory of Mind\nis a term from psychology about an individual's capacity for empathy\nand understanding of others.\nThis is an awareness of others being like yourself, with individual needs and intentions.\nOne of the abilities language users have, is to communicate about things \nthat are not concrete, like needs, ideas, or concepts.\nSimon Baron-Cohen\n,\nBritish psychologist and professor at the University of Cambridge,\nargues (1999) that \"Theory of Mind\" must have preceded languages,\nbased on knowledge about early human activities:\nTeaching\nBuilding Shared Goals\nBuilding Shared Plans\nIntentional Communication\nIntentional Sharing of Topic\nIntentional Sharing of Focus\nIntentional Persuasion\nIntentional Pretending\nIntentional Deception\nSelf-Awareness\nIn psychology, \"Theory of Mind\" means that people have thoughts, feelings and emotions\nthat affect their behavior.\nFuture AI systems must learn to understand that everyone (both people and AI objects)\nhave thoughts and feelings.\nFuture AI systems must know how to adjust their behavior to be able to walk among us.\nThe last step, before AI can be human, is machine consciousness.\nWe can not construct this software before we know much more about the human brain,\nmemory, and intelligence.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
