They are not real knowledge.\nYou use\nDescriptive Statistics\nto transform raw observations into data that you can understand.\nDescriptive Statistics Measurements\nDescriptive statistics are broken down into different measures:\nTendency\n(Measures of the Center)\nThe Mean (the average value)value\nThe Median (the mid point value)\nThe Mode (the most common value)\nSpread\n(Measures of Variability)\nMin and Max\nStandard Deviation\nVariance\nSkewness\nKurtosis\n\n\u2605\n+1",
