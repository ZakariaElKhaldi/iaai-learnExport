And what is even more remarkable: Even children master this skill.\nSpoken Languages\nWe are not sure of how old the spoken language is.\nThe topic is difficult to study because of the lack of evidence.\nWe don't know how it started. But we have a clue.\nThe great African apes, Pan and Gorilla, are our closest living relatives.\nWhy are they called \"Apes\"? Because they ape. Apes mime to get their message across.\nIt is assumed that the evolution of languages must have been a long process.\nOur ancestors might have started speaking a million years ago,\nbut with fewer words, more miming, and no grammar.\nThe Tower of Babel\nCognitive Development\nAccording to\nHauser, Chomsky, and Fitch (2002)\n, there are six aspects of language development:\nTheory of Mind\nUnderstanding Vocal Signals\nUnderstanding Imitation\nUnderstanding Numbers\nUnderstanding Intentional Communication\nUnderstanding Non-linguistic Representations\nHuman Languages\nHuman languages contain a limited set of\nWords\nput together in\nSentences\n:\nExample\nI'm going on holiday in my new car.\nVado in vacanza con la mia macchina nuova.\nMe voy de vacaciones en mi auto nuevo.\nIch fahre mit meinem neuen Auto in den Urlaub.\nComputer Languages\nComputers are programmed with a limited set of\nWords\nput together in computer\nStatements\n:\nExample\nvar points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];\npoints.sort(function(a, b){return a - b});\n\nWritten Languages\nEgyptian and Sumerian are the earliest known written languages.\n(The oldest written language in use today, is Chinese)\n3500 BC\nSumerian\n3000 BC\nEgyptian\n1500 BC\nChinese\n1500 BC\nVedic Sanskrit\n1500 BC\nGreek\n1000 BC\nHebrew\n900 BC\nAramaic\n700 BC\nEtruscan\n500 BC\nTamil\n700 BC\nLatin\n700 AC\nClassical Sanskrit\n500 AC\nArabic\n400 AC\nGothic (German)\n700 AC\nEnglish\n700 AC\nJapanese\n800 AC\nFrench\n900 AC\nItalian\n1000 AC\nSpanish\n\n\u2605\n+1",
