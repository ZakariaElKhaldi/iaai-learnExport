Used by Roman engineers, merchants and tax collectors.\nAnalog Computers\nThe Difference Engine\n(Charles Babbage 1822) was a mechanical machine\ndesigned to\nReduce the Time\nto calculate complex mathematical functions.\nThe Analytical Engine\n(Charles Babbage 1833) was a mechanical machine\ndesigned with modern computer elements like arithmetic, logic, and memory.\nBoth these \"computers\" used 10 digit (decimal) mechanical cogwheels to\nperform mathematical calculations:\n(Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. Science Museum. London)\nDigital Computers\nDigital Computers use 0/1 switches to perform calculations.\nThey operate on\nbinary\nvalues like 11100110 in contrast to\nanalog\nvalues like 230.\n\n+\n=\nThe first Electric Digital Computer was designed and built by Konrad Zuse in Germany (1941).\nIt used 2600 electrical relays as 0/1 switches. The clock speed was about 5 Hz.\nReplica of the Zuse Z3. Deutsches Museum. Munich.\nElectronic Computers\nFirst generation Computers\n(1945-1950)\nused vacuum tubes as binary switches.\nVacuum tubes are much faster than electrical relays.\nThe clock speed of these computers was between 500 KHz and 1 Mhz.\nSecond Generation Computers\nSecond generation Computers\n(1950-1960) used transistors as binary 0/1 switches.\nTransistors are much faster than vacuum tubes.\nThird Generation Computers\nThird generation Computers\n(1960) used integrated circuits as binary switches.\nIntegrated circuits are much faster than transistors.\nComputer Speed\nThe first electrical computer could do 5 instructions per second.\nThe first electronic computer did 5000 instructions per second.\nThe first PC did 5 million instructions per second.\nAMD was the first PC to reach 1 billion instructions per second.\nToday, IPhone 12 can do 11 billion instructions per second.\nYear\nComputer\nInstructions\nper Second\nBits\nper Instruction\n1941\nZ3\n5\n4\n1945\nENIAC\n5.000\n8\n1981\nIBM PC\n5.000.000\n16\n1995\nIntel Pentium PC\n100.000.000\n32\n2000\nAMD PC\n1.000.000.000\n64\n2020\n10.000.000.000\n128\nWhen Did it Start? Where Will it End?\nFrom the history above you can extract:\nComputers were designed to do calculations\nCharles Babbage created the first mechanical computer\nThe first digital computers used electromechanical switches\nVacuum tubes are much faster than electromechanical switches\nTransistors are much faster than vacuum tubes\nIntegrated circuits are much faster than transistors\nTomorrow's computes will be faster than the human brain?\n\"Computers are useless because they can only give you answers.\"\nPablo Picasso\nSmarter Than Humans?\nIf we believe in\nMoores Law\n:\nIn 2020, computers have the capacity of a mouse brain.\nIn 2030, computers might have the capacity of a human brain:\nSource:\nRay Kurzweil\n\n\u2605\n+1",
