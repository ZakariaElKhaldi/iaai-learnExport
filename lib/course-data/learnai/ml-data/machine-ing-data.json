Dates.\nMeasurements\nSize. Height. Weight.\nWords\nNames and Places.\nObservations\nCounting Cars.\nDescriptions\nIt is cold.\nIntelligence Needs Data\nHuman intelligence needs data:\nA real estate broker needs data about sold houses to estimate prices.\nArtificial Intelligence also needs data:\nA Machine Learning program needs data to estimate prices.\nData can help us to see and understand.\nData can help us to find new opportunities.\nData can help us to resolve misunderstandings.\nHealthcare\nHealthcare and life sciences collect public health data and patient data\nto learn how to improve patient care and save lives.\nBusiness\nThe most successful companies in many sectors are data driven.\nThey use sophisticated data analytics to learn how the company can perform better.\nFinance\nBanks and insurance companies collect and evaluate data about customers, loans and deposits\nto support strategic decision-making.\nStoring Data\nThe most common data to collect are Numbers and Measurements.\nOften data are stored in arrays representing the relationship between values.\nThis table contains house prices versus size:\nPrice\n7\n8\n8\n9\n9\n9\n10\n11\n14\n14\n15\nSize\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n110\n120\n130\n140\n150\nQuantitative vs. Qualitative\nQuantitative data are numerical:\n55 cars\n15 meters\n35 children\nQualitative data are descriptive:\nIt is cold\nIt is long\nIt was fun\nCensus or Sampling\nA\nCensus\nis when we collect data for every member of a group.\nA\nSample\nis when we collect data for some members of a group.\nIf we wanted to know how many Americans smoke cigarettes,\nwe could ask every person in the US (a census),\nor we could ask 10 000 people (a sample).\nA census is\nAccurate\n, but hard to do. A sample is\nInaccurate\n, but is easier to do.\nSampling Terms\nA\nPopulation\nis group of individuals (objects) we want to collect information from.\nA\nCensus\nis information about every individual in a population.\nA\nSample\nis information about a part of the population (In order to represent all).\nRandom Samples\nIn order for a sample to represent a population, it must be collected randomly.\nA\nRandom Sample\n, is a sample where every member of the population has an \nequal chance to appear in the sample.\nSampling Bias\nA\nSampling Bias\n(Error) occurs when samples are collected in such a way\nthat some individuals are less (or more) likely to be included in the sample.\nBig Data\nBig data is data that is impossible for humans to process\nwithout the assistance of advanced machines.\nBig data does not have any definition in terms of size,\nbut datasets are becoming larger and larger as we continously collect more and more data\nand store data at a lower and lower cost.\nData Mining\nWith big data comes complicated data structures.\nA huge part of big data processing is refining data.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
