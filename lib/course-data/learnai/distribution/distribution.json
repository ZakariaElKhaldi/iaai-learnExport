The peak always divides the distribution in half.\nNormal distribution is a\nProbability\ndistribution.\nA lot of observations follow the normal distribution:\nYour IQ\nYour Weight\nYour Height\nYour Salary\nYour Blood Pressure\nNormal distribution shows that values near the mean\nare more frequent than values far from the mean:\nDistance from the Mean Value\nPercentage of the Population\n1 Standard deviation\n68.27%\n2 Standard deviations\n95.45%\n3 Standard deviations\n99.73%\nThe\n68\u201395\u201399.7 Rule\n(aka The Empirical Rule), is a shorthand \nto remember the percentage of values that lie within the different bands of a normal distribution.\nNormal distribution is also known as the\nGaussian Distribution\nand the\nBell Curve\n.\nThe Margin of Error\nStatisticians will always try to predict everything with 100% accuracy.\nBut, there will always be some uncertainty.\nThe\nMargin of Error\nis the number that quantifies this statistical uncertainty.\nDifferent margins\ndefine different ranges for where we believe the correct answers can be found.\nThe acceptable margin\nis a matter of judgment, and relative to how important the answer is.\nThe more samples we collect, the lower the margin of error is:\nHow to Interpret Margin of Error\nSuppose 55% of a sampled population say they plan to vote \"Yes\".\nWhen projecting this to a whole population, you add/subtract the margin of error\nto give a range of possible results.\nWith a margin of error of 3%, you are confident that between 52% and 58% will vote \"Yes\".\nWith a margin of error of 10%, you are confident that between 45% and 65% will vote \"Yes\".\nSkewness\nSkewness\nis a distortion (an asymmetry) from the bell curve (normal distribution).\nKurtosis\nKurtosis\nis a also a distortion from the normal distribution (bell curve).\nWhile skewness describes a unexpected values in one tail, kurtosis describes unexpected values in both tails.\nImage: Negative kurtosis (lower than normal distribution).\nImage: Positive kurtosis (higher than normal distribution).\n\n\u2605\n+1",
