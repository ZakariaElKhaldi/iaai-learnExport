      "content": "To understand AI, it is important to understand the concept of Numbers and Counting.\nAI is About Numbers\nArtificial Intelligence is all about\nNumbers\n.\nNumbers are easy to understand: 1,2,3,4,5 ... 11,12,13,14,15.\nStudies of animals indicates that even animals can understand some numbers:\n2 Wives\n8 Sons\n5 Eggs\nThe need for numbers in the modern world is absolute. We cannot live without numbers:\n100 Dollar\nPi = 3.14\n365 Days\n25 Years\n20% Tax\n100 Miles\nAI is About Counting\nThe concept of numbers leads to the concept of counting.\nImagine prehistoric thinking:\nHow to count apples?\nHow to weigh corn?\nHow to pay?\nHow far is the ocean?\nArtificial Intelligence is a result of the human need for calculations.\nCounting is easy to understand: 2 + 2 = 4.\nStudies of animals indicates that animals can only understand very simple counting.\nHow do Homo Sapiens deal with calculations?\nComplex calculations are done by computers.\n\"Yes! Computers can be smarter than humans.\"\nBabylonian Numbers (Base 60)\nWe believe that the Babylonians started the development of complex counting.\nThe Babylonian number system has 60 different digits. It is a\nBase 60\nsystem.\nTwo Babylonian Scientists\nAbout 6000 Years ago ...\nTwo Babylonian scientists were talking (writing numbers as dots on a paper):\nScientist 1: \"We need to invent a number system\".\nScientist 2: \"What?\".\nScientist 1: \"We need to give every number a name\".\nScientist 2: \"You mean like 1, 2, and 3\".\nScientist 1: \"Exactly!\".\nScientist 2: \"But why?\".\nScientist 1: \"How can I tell you I have 7 sons, if you don't know what 7 is?\nScientist 2: \"Every number should have a name?\".\nScientist 1: \"Exactly!\".\nScientist 2: \"So, how many numbers do we need? 15?\".\nScientist 1: \"More. Some people have more than 15 sons\".\nScientist 2: \"Ok. 30 then. Just to be sure\".\nScientist 1: \"But people older than 30 should be able to tell their age\".\nScientist 2: \"Ok. 60 then\".\nSexagesimal (base 60)\nThe sexagesimal system (base 60):\nThere are 60 seconds in one minute\nThere are 60 minutes in one hour\n60 is very versatile. It can be divided by 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,30, and 60.\nThe Babylonian system was a place-value system, where the digits to\nthe left represented full values, much like our decimal system.\n1,5 means 65 (1 times 60, plus 5)\n3,30 means 210 (3 times 60, plus 30)\nThe reason why the Babylonians used 60 as the base,\nwas (we like to believe) that 60 is divisible with most numbers:\n1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30, and 60.\nThe downside was that the user had to remember\n60 different digits. But the system was smart. A lot of it is still in use today:\nWhat\nWe\nWhy\nA full circle\n360\u00b0\n6 x 60 = 360\nHalf a circle\n180\u00b0\n3 x 60 = 180\nOne Hour\n60\u00b0\n1 x 60 = 60 minutes\nThe Babylonians counted to 360 because of their sexagesimal (base-60) number system,\nwhich they inherited from earlier Mesopotamian cultures.\nThis system led to many mathematical and astronomical conventions that we still use today,\nincluding:\nDividing a circle into 360 degrees\nThe Babylonians observed that a year is roughly 360 days (based on early solar calendars).\nThey associated celestial movements with circular motion and divided the circle into 360 parts (degrees).\nUsing Base-60 (Sexagesimal) System\n60 is a highly composite number, meaning it has many divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60), making it useful for fractions and measurements.\n360 is a multiple of 60 (60 \u00d7 6), which fits neatly into their mathematical framework.\nAstronomical and Calendar Significance\nThe Babylonians tracked lunar and solar cycles, which were closely linked to the approximate 360-day year.\nThey divided the sky into 12 zodiac constellations, each spanning 30 degrees.\nInfluence on Time Measurement\nThe 60-minute hour and 60-second minute also originate from the Babylonian system.\nThese divisions ensured easy calculations for astronomers and timekeepers.\nTheir system was so effective that it persisted through Greek and Hellenistic astronomy and eventually shaped modern mathematics, geometry, and timekeeping.\nThe origin of the\nSexagesimal system\n(base 60) has been lost in history.\nBut it looks like it has been used in parallel with the\nDozenal system\nsince ancient times.\nDozenal (base 12)\nThe dozenal system (base 12):\nThere are 12 in a dozen\nThere are 12 hours in a day\nThere are 12 hours in a night\nThere are 12 months in a year\n12 is very versatile. It can be divided by 1,2,3,4,6,and 12.\nHow to Count Dozenal\nWith two hands, you can count to 60.\nEach of your fingers have 3 joints:\nThe thumb counts to 12 on left hand.\nThe right hand counts the number of left hands.\n1 full hand = 12\n2 full hands = 24\n3 full hands = 36\n4 full hands = 48\n5 full hands = 60\nRoman Numbers (Base 10)\nRoman numbers originated in Rome and was used in Europe into the Middle Ages.\nSymbol:\nI\nV\nX\nL\nC\nD\nM\nValue:\n1\n5\n10\n50\n100\n500\n1000\nThe Romans used a\nBase 10\nsystem.\nPossibly because they used their 10 fingers to count.\nToday, most of the world use a\nBase 10\nnumber system:\nWestern numbers, Chinese numbers, Brahmi numbers, Greek numbers, Hebrew numbers...\n5 means 5\n50 means 5 times 10\n500 means 5 times 100\n57 means 5 times 10, plus 7\n75 means 7 times 10, plus 5\nDigital Numbers (Base 2)\nHumans can count with base 10 numbers, computers can not.\nElectricity cannot count. Electricity can only be On and Off.\nComputers use Electricity or Magnetism to represent On and Off.\nComputers use\nDigital Numbers\nlike 11100110 (in contrast to\nBase 10 Numbers\nlike 230).\nDigital numbers (11100110) are also called\nBinary Numbers\n.\nYou will learn more about digital computers in the \nMan vs. Computer\nComputers can handle an unlimited amount of numbers.\nHumans can not.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
