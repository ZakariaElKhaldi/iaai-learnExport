Are big dogs smarter?\nBirds have very small brains, but they know they should not make children in the autumn,\nand they know when to fly to the south.\nBees have even smaller brains, but they know how to communicate \nabout where to find nectar.\nPlants have no brain, but they know how to reproduce, and how to prepare for the winter.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
