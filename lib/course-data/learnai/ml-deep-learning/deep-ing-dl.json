      "content": "The deep learning revolution\nstarted around 2010.\nSince then, Deep Learning has solved many \"unsolvable\" problems.\nThe deep learning revolution was not started by a single discovery.\nIt more or less happened when several needed factors were ready:\nComputers were fast enough\nComputer storage was big enough\nBetter training methods were invented\nBetter tuning methods were invented\nNeurons\nScientists agree that our brain has between 80 and 100 billion neurons.\nThese neurons have hundreds of billions connections between them.\nImage credit: University of Basel, Biozentrum.\nNeurons (aka Nerve Cells) are the fundamental units of our brain and nervous system.\nThe neurons are responsible for receiving input from the external world,\nfor sending output (commands to our muscles),\nand for transforming the electrical signals in between.\nNeural Networks\nArtificial Neural Networks\nare normally called Neural Networks (NN).\nNeural networks are in fact multi-layer\nPerceptrons\n.\nThe perceptron defines the first step into multi-layered neural networks.\nNeural Networks\nare the essence of\nDeep Learning\n.\nNeural Networks\nare one of the most significant discoveries in history.\nNeural Networks can solve problems that can NOT be solved by algorithms:\nMedical Diagnosis\nFace Detection\nVoice Recognition\nThe Neural Network Model\nInput data (Yellow) are processed against a hidden layer (Blue)\nand modified against another hidden layer (Green) to produce the final output (Red).\nTom Mitchell\nTom Michael Mitchell (born 1951) is an American computer scientist and University Professor at the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).\nHe is a former Chair of the Machine Learning Department at CMU.\n\"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T\nand performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"\nTom Mitchell (1999)\nE: Experience (the number of times).\nT: The Task (driving a car).\nP: The Performance (good or bad).\nThe Giraffe Story\nIn 2015,\nMatthew Lai\n, a student at Imperial College in London created a neural network called\nGiraffe\n.\nGiraffe could be trained in 72 hours to play chess at the same level as an international master.\nComputers playing chess are not new, but the way this program was created was new.\nSmart chess playing programs take years to build, while Giraffe was built in 72 hours with a neural network.\nDeep Learning\nClassical programming uses programs (algorithms) to create results:\nTraditional Computing\nData + Computer Algorithm =\nResult\nMachine Learning uses results to create programs (algorithms):\nMachine Learning\nData + Result =\nComputer Algorithm\nMachine Learning\nMachine Learning is often considered equivalent with Artificial Intelligence.\nThis is not correct. Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.\nMachine Learning is a discipline of AI that uses data to teach machines.\n\"Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being programmed.\"\nArthur Samuel (1959)\nIntelligent Decision Formula\nSave the result of all actions\nSimulate all possible outcomes\nCompare the new action with the old ones\nCheck if the new action is good or bad\nChoose the new action if it is less bad\nDo it all over again\nThe fact that computers can do this millions of times, \nhas proven that computers can make very intelligent decisions.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
