Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.\nMachine Learning is a discipline of AI that uses data to teach machines.\n\"Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being programmed.\"\nArthur Samuel (1959)\nIntelligent Decision Formula\nSave the result of all actions\nSimulate all possible outcomes\nCompare the new action with the old ones\nCheck if the new action is good or bad\nChoose the new action if it is less bad\nDo it all over again\nThe fact that computers can do this millions of times, \nhas proven that computers can make very intelligent decisions.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
