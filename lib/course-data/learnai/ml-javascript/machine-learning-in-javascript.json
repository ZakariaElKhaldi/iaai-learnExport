All developers can use it.\nSecurity is built in. JavaScript cannot access your files.\nJavaScript is faster than Python.\nJavaScript can use hardware acceleration.\nJavaScript runs in the browser\nJavaScript is Good for Machine Learning\nMachine Learning can be math-heavy. The nature of neural networks is highly technical,\nand the jargon that goes along with it tends to scare people away.\nThis is where JavaScript comes to help, with easy to understand software\nto simplifying the process of creating and training neural networks.\nWith new Machine Learning libraries, JavaScript developers can add \nMachine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to web applications.\nJavaScript Machine Learning Libraries\nMachine Learning\nin the\nBrowser\nmeans:\nMachine Learning in JavaScript\nMachine Learning for the Web\nMachine Learning for Everyone\nMachine Learning on more Platforms\nAdvantages:\nEasy to use. Nothing to install.\nPowerful graphics. Browsers support WebGL.\nBetter privacy. Data can stay on the client.\nMore platforms. JavaScript runs on mobile devices.\nBrain.js\nBrain.js\nis a JavaScript library that makes it easy to understand Neural Networks\nbecause it hides the complexity of the mathematics.\nBrain.js is simple to use. You do not need to know neural networks in details to work with Brain.js.\nBrain.js provides multiple neural network implementations as different neural nets can be trained to do different things well.\nLearn More ...\nml5.js\nml5.js is trying to make machine learning more accessible to a wider audience.\nThe ml5 team is working to wrap machine learning functionality in friendlier ways.\nThe example below uses only\nthree lines\nof code to classify an image:\n<img id=\"myImage\" src=\"pic1.jpg\" width=\"100%\">\n<script>\nconst classifier =  ml5.imageClassifier('MobileNet');\nclassifier.classify(document.getElementById(\"myImage\"), gotResult);\nfunction gotResult(error, results)\n{ ... }\n</script>\n\nTry substitute pic1.jpg with pic2.jpg, pic3.jpg and pic4.jpg.\nTensorFlow\nTensorFlow Playground\nis a web application written in\nd3.js\n.\nWith TensorFlow Playground you can learn about\nNeural Networks\n(NN) without math.\nIn your own\nWeb Browser\nyou can create a Neural Network and see the result.\nTensorFlow.js was \nMath in the Browser\nMath.js\nis an extensive math library for JavaScript and Node.js.\nMath.js is powerful and easy to use.\nIt comes with a large set of built-in functions,\na flexible expression parser, and solutions to work with many data types like\nnumbers, big numbers, complex numbers, fractions, units, arrays, and matrices.\nPlotting in the Browser\nHere is a list of some JavaScript libraries to use for both Machine Learning graphs and other HTML charts:\nHTML Canvas\nPlotly.js\nChart.js\nGoogle Chart\nD3.js\nPlotting Equations\nEnter Equation:\nScatter\nDraw Line\n\nPlotting Values\nEnter X and Y Values:\nScatter\nDraw Lines\n\nWebGL API\nWebGL\nis a JavaScript API for rendering 2d and 3D graphics in any browser.\nWebGL can run on both integrated and standalone graphic cards in any PC.\nWebGL brings 3D graphics to the web browser. Major browser vendors Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome),\nMicrosoft (Edge), and Mozilla (Firefox) are members of the WebGL Working Group.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
