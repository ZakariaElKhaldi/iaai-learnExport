(Wikipedia)\n\nSingle Page\nThe web design trend shifts from regular clicking to vertical scrolling.\nScrolling allows users to see all the web content on the one page.\nThis single page technique has been used by social networks a long time, until somebody \ndiscovered that it suits other pages as well.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
