      "content": "Radar Charts\nRadar charts show multivariate data as values relative to a center point.\nNote:\nMultivariate data has more than one variables. For example, a dataset containing age and height is multivariate because it has two variables.\nRadar charts can only show data that can be ordered from low to high.\nNote:\nData which can be placed in an order, from low to high, like numbers and letter grades from A to F are called ordinal data. You can read more about ordinal data at\nStatistics - Measurement Levels.\nRadar charts are suited for showing\nsimilarities\nand\noutliers\nin the data.\nNote:\nAn outlier is a data point that has\nunusually\nlarge/small values compared to the rest of the data.\nExcel has three types of radar charts:\nRadar (\n)\nRadar with markers (\n)\nFilled radar (\n)\nNote:\nRadar chart is also known as\nweb chart\n,\nspider chart\nand\nstar chart\n.\nRadar\nRadar charts show data as as vertices on a polygon.\nThe relevant distance from the center of the polygon shows the value of the data point.\nExample\nLet's compare the stats for Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle.\nCopy the values to follow along:\nName\tHP\tAttack\tDefense\tSp. Atk\tSp. Def\tSpeed\n    Bulbasaur\t45\t49\t49\t65\t65\t45\n    Charmander\t39\t52\t43\t60\t50\t65\n    Squirtle\t44\t48\t65\t50\t64\t43\nCopy Values\nSelect the range\nA1:G4\nNote:\nThis menu is accessed by\nexpanding the ribbon\n.\nClick on the\nInsert\nmenu, then click on the Other Charts menu (\n) and choose\nRadar\n(\n) from the drop-down menu\nYou should get the chart below:\nThe chart gives a visual overview for the Pokemon stats.\nBulbasaur is shown in blue, Charmander in orange and Squirtle in gray.\nThe chart shows that Charmander has the highest speed and lowest special defense. Squirtle has the highest defense and lowest special attack. The three Pokemon have similar HP and attack stats.\nRadar With Markers\nRadar with Markers is similar to radar chart. The only difference is that the data points are highlighted with markers.\nExample\nLet's compare the stats for Bulbasaur evolutions to Ivysaur and Venusaur.\nCopy the values to follow along:\nName\tHP\tAttack\tDefense\tSp. Atk\tSp. Def\tSpeed\n    Bulbasaur\t45\t49\t49\t65\t65\t45\n    Ivysaur\t60\t62\t63\t80\t80\t60\n    Venusaur\t80\t82\t83\t100\t100\t80\nCopy Values\nSelect the range\nA1:G4\nNote:\nThis menu is accessed by\nexpanding the ribbon\n.\nClick on the\nInsert\nmenu, then click on the Other Charts menu (\n) and choose\nRadar with Markers\n(\n) from the drop-down menu\nYou should get the chart below:\nThe chart gives a visual overview for the Pokemon stats.\nBulbasaur is shown in blue, Ivysaur in orange and Venusaur in gray.\nThe chart shows that with each evolution, the stats increase in a similar manner.\nFilled Radar\nFilled radar is similar to radar chart. The only difference is that inside the charts are filled with color.\nExample\nLet's compare the stats for Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle.\nCopy the values to follow along:\nName\tHP\tAttack\tDefense\tSp. Atk\tSp. Def\tSpeed\n    Bulbasaur\t45\t49\t49\t65\t65\t45\n    Charmander\t39\t52\t43\t60\t50\t65\n    Squirtle\t44\t48\t65\t50\t64\t43\nCopy Values\nSelect the range\nA1:G4\nNote:\nThis menu is accessed by\nexpanding the ribbon\n.\nClick on the\nInsert\nmenu, then click on the Other Charts menu (\n) and choose\nRadar\n(\n) from the drop-down menu\nYou should get the chart below:\nThe chart gives a visual overview for the Pokemon stats.\nBulbasaur is shown in blue, Charmander in orange and Squirtle in gray.\nThe chart shows that Charmander has the highest speed.\nNote that since the charts are overshadowing each other, the chart cannot give any more information.\nCaution:\nIt's better to avoid using filled radar charts with multiple data columns because some data columns can overshadow others.\nExample (The Extreme Case)\nLet's compare the stats for Bulbasaur evolutions to Ivysaur and Venusaur.\nCopy the values to follow along:\nName\tHP\tAttack\tDefense\tSp. Atk\tSp. Def\tSpeed\n    Bulbasaur\t45\t49\t49\t65\t65\t45\n    Ivysaur\t60\t62\t63\t80\t80\t60\n    Venusaur\t80\t82\t83\t100\t100\t80\nCopy Values\nSelect the range\nA1:G4\nNote:\nThis menu is accessed by\nexpanding the ribbon\n.\nClick on the\nInsert\nmenu, then click on the Other Charts menu (\n) and choose\nRadar with Markers\n(\n) from the drop-down menu\nYou should get the chart below:\nIn this chart, Venusaur, which is shown in gray, overshadows all the other Pokemon.\nThe only information this chart gives is that Venusaur has larger or equal stat values than both Bulbasaur and Ivysaur.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
