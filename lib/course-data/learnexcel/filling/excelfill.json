      "content": "Filling\nFilling makes your life easier and is used to fill ranges with values, so that you do not have to type manual entries.\nFilling can be used for:\nCopying\nSequences\nDates\nFunctions (*)\nFor now, do not think of functions. We will cover that in a later chapter.\nHow To Fill\nFilling is done by selecting a cell, clicking the fill icon and selecting the range using drag and mark while holding the left mouse button down.\nThe fill icon is found in the bottom right corner of the cell and has the icon of a small square. Once you hover over it your mouse pointer will change its icon to a thin cross.\nClick the fill icon and hold down the left mouse button, drag and mark the range that you want to cover.\nIn this example, cell\nA1\nwas selected and the range\nA1:A10\nwas marked.\nNow that we have learned how to fill. Let's look into how to copy with the fill function.\nFill Copies\nFilling can be used for copying. It can be used for both numbers and words.\nLet's have a look at numbers first.\nIn this example we have typed the value\nA1(1)\n:\nFilling the range\nA1:A10\ncreates\nten copies\nof\n1\n:\nThe same principle goes for text.\nIn this example we have typed\nA1(Hello World)\n.\nFilling the range\nA1:A10\ncreates ten copies of \"Hello World\":\nNow you have learned how to fill and to use it for copying both numbers and words. Let's have a look at sequences.\nFill Sequences\nFilling can be used to create sequences. A sequence is an order or a pattern. We can use the filling function to continue the order that has been set.\nSequences can for example be used on numbers and dates.\nLet's start with learning how to count from 1 to 10.\nThis is different from the last example because this time we do not want to copy, but to count from 1 to 10.\nStart with typing\nA1(1)\n:\nFirst we will show an example which does not work, then we will do a working one. Ready?\nLets type the value (\n1\n) into the cell\nA2\n, which is what we have in\nA1\n. Now we have the same values in both\nA1\nand\nA2\n.\nLet's use the fill\nfunction\nfrom\nA1:A10\nto see what happens. Remember to mark both values before you fill the range.\nWhat happened is that we got the same values as we did with copying. This is because the fill function assumes that we want to create copies as we had two of the same values in both the cells\nA1(1)\nand\nA2(1)\n.\nChange the value of\nA2(1)\nto\nA2(2)\n. We now have two different values in the cells\nA1(1)\nand\nA2(2)\n. Now, fill\nA1:A10\nagain. Remember to mark both the values (holding down shift) before you fill the \nrange:\nCongratulations!\nYou have now counted from 1 to 10.\nThe fill function understands the pattern typed in the cells and continues it for us.\nThat is why it created copies when we had entered the value (\n1\n) in both cells, \nas it saw no pattern. When we entered (\n1\n) and (\n2\n) in the cells it was able to understand the pattern and that the \nA3\nshould be (\n3\n).\nLet's create another sequence. Type\nA1(2)\nand\nA2(4)\n:\nNow, fill\nA1:A10\n:\nIt counts from\n2 to 20\nin the range\nA1:A10\n.\nThis is because we created an order with\nA1(2)\nand\nA2(4)\n.\nThen it fills the \nA3(6)\n,\nA4(8)\n,\nA5(10)\nand so on. The fill function understands the pattern and helps us continue it.\nSequence of Dates\nThe fill function can also be used to fill dates.\nNote:\nThe date format depends on you\nregional language settings\n.\nFor example\n14.03.2023\nvs.\n3/14/2023\n.\nTest it by typing\nA1(29.07.2021)\n:\nAnd fill the range\nA1:A10\n:\nThe fill function has filled 10 days from\nA1(29.07.2021)\nto\nA10(07.08.2021)\n.\nNote that it switched from July to August in cell\nA4\n. It knows the calendar and will count real dates.\nCombining Words and Letters\nWords and letters can also be combined.\nType\nA1(Hello 1)\nand\nA2(Hello 2)\n:\n\nA1:A10\nto see what happens:\nThe result is that it counts from\nA1(Hello 1)\nto\nA10(Hello 10)\n. Only the numbers have changed.\nIt recognised the pattern of the numbers and continued it for us. Words and numbers can be combined, as long as you use a recognizable pattern for the numbers.\nTest Yourself With Exercises\nExcel Exercise:\nComplete the sequence of numbers:\nA1(1)\nA2(2)\nA3\nSubmit Answer \u00bb\nStart the Exercise\n\n\u2605\n+1",
