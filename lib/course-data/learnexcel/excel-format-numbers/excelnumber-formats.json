For example instead of using\nUSD\nlike in the example you can decide for\n$\nor\nEUR\n. It is changed in the dropdrop menu, clicking the\nMore Number Formats\nin the bottom of the menu. Then, clicking on\nCurrency\n.\nNotice that the numbers look like a mess. Let's solve that by decreasing the decimals. This helps to make the presentation more neat.\nDecimals\nThe number of decimals can be increased and decreased.\nThere are two commands:\nIncrease Decimal\nDecrease Decimal\nClicking them reduces or increases the number of decimals.\nThe commands can be found \nNote:\nDecreasing Decimals can make Excel round up or down numbers as more decimals get removed. This may be confusing if you are working on advanced calculations which require accurate numbers.\nLet's clean this up, step by step:\nMark the range\nB2:C8\nClick the\nDecrease Decimal\nbutton two times\nGreat!\nDo the same for\nB10\n,\nB11\nand\nB13\n:\nThat looks a lot better!\nPro tip:\nThe arrow in the angle in the top left corner by\nrow 1\nand\ncolumn A\ncan be clicked to mark all cells in the sheet. This can be useful if you want to change the Number format or change Decimals for all cells.\nChapter summary\nNumber formats can be changed to make the spreadsheet more understandable or to prepare cells for functions. You can increase and decrease decimals to make the presentation neat.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
