You select a color by clicking it:\nThe \"\nMore Colors\n\" option allows you to select custom colors by entering a RGB or HEX code.\nHexadecimal Colors\nExcel supports Hexadecimal color values\nA hexadecimal color is specified with:\n#\nRR\nGG\nBB\n.\nRR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) are hexadecimal integers between 00 and FF specifying the intensity of the color.\nFor example, #0000FF is displayed as blue, because the blue component is set to its highest value (FF) and the others are set to 00.\nRGB Colors\nExcel supports RGB color values.\nAn RGB color value is specified with:\nrgb(\nRED\n,\nGREEN\n,\nBLUE\n)\n.\nEach parameter defines the intensity of the color as an integer between 0 and 255.\nFor example, rgb(0,0,255) is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.\nTip:\nTry .com color picker to find your color!\n\nApplying colors\nColors can be applied to cells, text and borders.\nColors are applied to cells by using the \"\nFill color\n\" function.\nHow to apply colors to cells:\nSelect color\nSelect range\nClick the Fill Color button\nThe \"\nFill color\n\" button remembers the color you used the last time.\nColor options are explored by clicking on the arrow-down icon (\n),\n\nThe option allows selection of theme colors, standard colors or use of HEX or RGB codes by clicking on the More Colors option:\nColors are made from red, green, blue and are universal. Entering a color in one way will give you the code in the other. For example if you enter a HEX code, it will give you the RGB code for the same color.\nLet's try some examples.\nStarting with\ntheme\nand\nstandard\ncolors:\nGreat!\nTry to apply the following colors:\nTheme color blue (accent 5) to A3:F3.\nTheme color green (accent 6) and A5:F5.\nDid you make it?\nLet's apply colors using HEX and RGB codes.\nApply HEX code #ffcb05 to A7:F7:\nStep by step:\nSelect\nA7:F7\nOpen color options\nClick\nMore colors\nInsert\n#ffcb05\nin the\nHEX\ninput field\nHit enter\nNotice that applying the HEX code gives the RGB code for the same color, and shows where that color is positioned on the color map.\nApply RGB code\n60\n,\n90\n,\n166\nto\nA9:F9\nStep by step:\nSelect\nA9:F9\nOpen color options\nClick More colors\nInsert\n60\n,\n90\n,\n166\nin the\nRGB\ninput field\nHit enter\nNotice that entering the RGB code also gives the HEX code and shows you where the color is positioned on the color map.\nWell done!\nYou have successfully applied colors using the standard, theme, HEX and RGB codes.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
