Check out how to add this in the\nformat borders chapter\n.\nYou can\nchoose any range\nfor where the Highlight Cell Rule should apply. It can be a few cells, a single column, a single row, or a combination of multiple cells, rows and columns.\nLet's first apply the\nAbove Average\nrule to the HP values.\n\"Above Average\" Rule, step by step:\nSelect the range\nC2:C11\nfor HP values\nClick on the Conditional Formatting icon\nin the ribbon, from\nHome\nmenu\nSelect\nTop/Bottom Rules\nfrom the drop-down menu\nSelect\nAbove Average\nfrom the menu\nThis will open a dialog box where you can specify the value and the appearance option.\nSelect the appearance option \"Green Fill with Dark Green Text\" from the dropdown menu\nNow, the cells with above average HP values (more than 77.2) will be highlighted in green:\nLet's try the same with the below average HP values.\nNote:\nMultiple rules can be applied to the same range.\nRepeat the steps, but instead choose\nBelow Average\nin the menu and select the \"Light Red Fill with Dark Red Text\" appearance option.\nNow, the below average values are also highlighted:\nNote:\nYou can remove the Highlight Cell Rules with\nManage Rules\n.\nNotice that there are more below average values than above average values. Why could this be?\nThe number of above or below average value cells in a range will depend on the actual values in the range.\nIf some values in the range are extra large this will increase the average by a lot.\nLet's add a fictional Pokemon with a very high HP stat value to illustrate this:\nThe fictional Wigglytuffest has 1000 HP, which increases the average value all the way up to more than 161.\nNow, only Wigglytuffest has an above average HP stat value, and every other Pokemon has below average HP stat values.\nNote:\nThis kind of average value is referred to as\nthe mean\n.\nYou can learn more about different kinds of average values are calculated in the\nStatistics - Average chapter\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
