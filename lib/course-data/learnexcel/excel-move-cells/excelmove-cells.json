      "content": "Moving Cells\nThere are two ways to move cells:\nDrag and drop\nor by\ncopy and paste\n.\nDrag and Drop\nLet's start by typing or copying some values that we can work with:\n309\t39\n320\t35\n318\t45\n314\t44\nCopy Values\n\nA1:B4\n:\nYou can drag and drop the range by pressing and holding the left mouse button on the border. The mouse cursor will change to the move symbol when you hover over the border.\nDrag and drop it when you see the symbol.\nMove the range to\nB2:C5\nas shown in the picture:\nGreat!\nNow you have created more space, so that we have room for more data.\nNote:\nIt is important to give context to the data, making the spreadsheet easy to understand. This can be done by adding text which explains the data.\nLet's go ahead and give the data more context. Type or copy the following values:\nHealth\tAttack\nCharmander\t309\t39\nPikachu\t320\t35\nBulbasaur\t318\t45\nSquirtle\t314\t44\nCopy Values\nYes, that is right, we are looking at Pokemons! Giving context to the data is always helpful.\n\nCut and Paste\nRanges can be moved by cutting and pasting values from one place to another.\nTip:\nYou can cut using the hotkey CTRL+X and paste by CTRL+V. This saves you time.\nMark the range\nA1:C5\nRight click the marked area, and click on the \"Cut\" command, which has scissors as its icon:\nCutting makes the range white-grey with dotted borders. This indicates that the range is cutted and ready for pasting.\nRight click the paste destination\nB6\nand left click the paste icon.\nYou have successfully cutted and pasted the range from\nA1:C5\nto\nB6:D10\n.\nCopy and paste\nCopy and paste works in the same way as cut and paste. The difference is that it does not remove the original cells.\nLet's copy the cells back from\nB6:D10\nto\nA1:C5\n.\nTip:\nYou can copy using the hotkey CTRL+C and paste by CTRL+V. This saves you time. Try it!\nMark the range\nB6:D10\n.\nRight click the marked area, and click on the \"Copy\" command which has two papers as its icon.\nCopying gives the range a dotted green border. This indicates that the range is copied and ready for pasting.\nRight click the paste destination\nA1\nand left click the paste icon:\nThe difference between cutting and copying, is that cutting removes the originals, while copying leaves the originals.\n\nA1:C5\nrange.\nDelete Data\nSelect the original cells and remove them by pressing the \"Delete\" button on the keyboard:\nTest Yourself With Exercises\nExcel Exercise:\nType the cell in the bottom right corner of the range\nB2:C5\n:\nC\nSubmit Answer \u00bb\nStart the Exercise\n\n\u2605\n+1",
