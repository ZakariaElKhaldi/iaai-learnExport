Def is now displayed in the table.\nThe settings of the fields that you have moved to the right side can be changed.\nClick the downwards arrow to access the settings.\nThis is possible in the four areas (Filters, rows, columns and, values).\nChapter summary\nTablePivot can be used both simple and advanced.\nIt can be set up in many different ways.\nYou can configure on many different layers cross filters, rows, columns and values.\nHow you set it up depends on your needs and how you want to present the data.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
