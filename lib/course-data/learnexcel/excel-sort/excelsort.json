Sorting just one can breaks the relationship between columns.\nThis is shown in an example later in this chapter.\nThe commands are found in the Ribbon under the\nSort & Filter\nmenu (\n)\nExample Sort (text)\nSort the Pokemons in the range\nA2:A21\nby their\nName\n, ascending from smallest to largest (A-Z).\nSelect\nA2:A21\nOpen the\nSort & Filter\nmenu\nClick\nSort Ascending\nNote:\nA1\nis not included as it is the header for the column.

The sort commands work for both text and numbers.\nA Non-Working Example (sorting one column in a range)\nIn this example we have two columns with related data. Column\nA\nis the Pokemons\nNames\nand Column\nB\nis their\nTotal stats\n. Try sorting just one of the columns (\nA2:A21\n) ascending by their\nNames\n.\nThe attempt to sort results in a warning.\nIt is not recommended to sort the names alone because it will break the relationship between the Pokemons\nNames\nand their\nTotal stats\n.\nClick \"Just sort\" to see what happens.\nThis breaks the relationship with Column\nA\nand\nB\n. The Pokemons now have wrong Total stats.\nClicking the other option in the warning \"Expand and Sort\" makes the sort function include Column\nB\nand sorts them in relation to each other.\nSorting More Than One Column\nSelect the whole range when sorting ranges with more than one column.\nNote:\nWhen sorting multiple columns, it will always sort by the first column (leftmost).\nSelect\nA2:B21\nand sort the range ascending.\nBy selecting range\nA2:B21\nit sorts correctly, keeping the relationship between the data (Column\nA\nand\nB\n).\nIn the \nFilter\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
