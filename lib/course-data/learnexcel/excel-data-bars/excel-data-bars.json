It can be a few cells, a single column, a single row, or a combination of multiple cells, rows and columns.\nNote:\nThe size of the data bars depends on the\nsmallest\nand\nlargest\ncell value in the range.\nLet's apply the\nData Bars\nconditional formatting to the Speed values.\n\"Data Bars\", step by step:\nSelect the range\nC2:C10\nfor Speed values\nClick on the Conditional Formatting icon\nin the ribbon, from\nHome\nmenu\nSelect\nData Bars\nfrom the drop-down menu\nSelect the \"Green Data Bars\" color option from the\nGradient Fill\nmenu\nNote:\nBoth\nGradient Fill\nand\nSolid Fill\nwork the same way. The only difference between those, and the color options are aesthetic.\nNow, all of the Speed value cells have a green bar showing how big the value is compared to the other values in the range:\nElectrode has the highest value, 140, so the bar fills the entire cell.\nThe other bars are scaled relative to the highest value and 0 by default.\nExeggcute has the lowest value, 40, so this is the shortest bar. Though, it is larger than 0, so there is still a small bar.\nLet's see what happens if we add a fictional Pokemon with a 0 Speed value:\nThe fictional Neutrinode has a Speed value of 0, so this becomes an invisible \"minimum\" bar.\nLet's see what happens if we add another fictional Pokemon with a negative Speed value:\nNow, the fictional Positrode has the lowest Speed value, -140, so this becomes an invisible \"minimum\" bar.\nNotice that all the other bars have now been scaled relative to the new minimum (-140).\nNeutrinode's Speed value of 0 is now in the middle between -140 and 140, so the cell has a bar filling half the cell.\nElectrode still has the highest Speed value, 140, so this bar still fills the entire cell.\nNote:\nYou can remove the Highlight Cell Rules with\nManage Rules\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
