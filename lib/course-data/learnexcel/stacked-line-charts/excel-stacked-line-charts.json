You can read more about ordinal data at\nStatistics - Measurement Levels.\nExample\nLet's see how the average stats add up across Pokemon generations\nCopy the values to follow along:\nNote: This data is rounded to one decimal.\nGen\tAvg HP\tAvg Attack\tAvg Defense\n    Gen 1\t64,7\t73,9\t69,6\n    Gen 2\t70,6\t68,3\t69,5\n    Gen 3\t65,6\t75,8\t70,5\n    Gen 4\t72,6\t80,5\t77,3\n    Gen 5\t71,6\t82,2\t72,0\n    Gen 6\t68,5\t74,8\t76,3\nCopy Values\nSelect the range\nA1:D7\nfor labels and data\nNote:\nThis menu is accessed by\nexpanding the ribbon\n.\nClick on the\nInsert\nmenu, then click on the Line menu (\n) and choose\nStacked Line\n(\n) from the drop-down menu\nYou should get the chart below:\nThe chart gives a visual overview for the average Pokemon stats over generations.\nThe blue line shows the average HP, the orange line show the addition of average HP and Average attack. Finally, the gray line shows the sum of all the stats once all the average stats are added.\nThis chart shows that 4th generation Pokemon have the highest stats on average.\nStacked Line with Markers\nStacked line with markers highlights data points with markers on a stacked line chart.\nExample\nLet's see how the average stats add up across Pokemon generations\nCopy the values to follow along:\nNote: This data is rounded to one decimal.\nGen\tAvg HP\tAvg Attack\tAvg Defense\n    Gen 1\t64,7\t73,9\t69,6\n    Gen 2\t70,6\t68,3\t69,5\n    Gen 3\t65,6\t75,8\t70,5\n    Gen 4\t72,6\t80,5\t77,3\n    Gen 5\t71,6\t82,2\t72,0\n    Gen 6\t68,5\t74,8\t76,3\nCopy Values\nSelect the range\nA1:D7\nfor labels and data\nNote:\nThis menu is accessed by\nexpanding the ribbon\n.\nClick on the\nInsert\nmenu, then click on the Line menu (\n) and choose\nStacked Line with Markers\n(\n) from the drop-down menu\nYou should get the chart below:\nThe chart gives a visual overview for the average Pokemon stats over generations.\nThe blue line shows the average HP, the orange line show the addition of average HP and Average attack.
