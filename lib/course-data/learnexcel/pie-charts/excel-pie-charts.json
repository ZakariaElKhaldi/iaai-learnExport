This can make it easier to understand the differences between categories.\nDoughnut Chart\nDoughnut charts arrange the data as slices in a circle with hollow center.\nDoughnut charts are often used when you have more than one data column.\nNote:\nA doughnut chart with one data column shows the same information as a 2-D pie chart.\nExample\nWe want to find the proportion of types \"Grass\", \"Fire\", \"Water\" and \"Bug\". in generation 1 Pokemon and compare it to the proportions in generation 2.\nYou can copy the values to follow along:\nType\tCount Gen1\tCount Gen 2\n    Grass\t12\t9\n    Fire\t12\t8\n    Water\t30\t18\n    Bug\t13\t10\nCopy Values\nSelect the range\nA1:C5\nClick on the\nInsert\nmenu, then click on the Pie menu (\n) and choose\nDoughnut\n(\n) from the drop-down menu\nNote:\nThis menu is accessed by\nexpanding the ribbon\n.\nFollowing the steps above, you will get the following chart:\nThe chart gives a visual overview of the number of 1st and 2nd generation Grass, Fire, Water and Bug type Pokemon.\nGeneration 1 Pokemon are shown in the inner circle and generation 2 Pokemon are shown in the outer circle.\nType \"Grass\" is shown in blue, \"Fire\" in orange, \"Water\" in gray and \"Bug\" in yellow.\nThis chart shows that \"Water\" type Pokemon are the most common in both generations.\nNote:\nThe chart can be customized by adding labels. This can make it easier to understand the differences between different categories.\nNote:\nBased on this chart, you cannot say which generation has more Pokemon.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
