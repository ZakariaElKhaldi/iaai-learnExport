      "content": "Overview\nThis chapter is about giving you an overview of Excel. Excel's structure is made of two pieces, the\nRibbon\nand the\nSheet\n.\nHave a look at the picture below. The\nRibbon\nis marked with a red rectangle and the\nSheet\nis marked with a yellow rectangle:\nFirst, let's start with explaining the\nRibbon\n.\nThe Ribbon explained\nThe\nRibbon\nprovides shortcuts to Excel commands. A command is an action that allows you to make something happen. This can for example be to: insert a table, change the font size, or to change the color of a cell.\nThe\nRibbon\nmay look crowded and hard to understand at first. Don't be scared, It will become easier to navigate and use as you learn more. Most of the time we tend to use the same functionalities over again.\nThe\nRibbon\nis made up by the\nApp launcher\n,\nTabs\n,\nGroups\nand\nCommands\n. In this section we will explain the different parts of the\nRibbon\n.\nApp launcher\nThe App launcher icon has nine dots and is called the Office 365 navigation bar. It allows you to access the different parts of the Office 365 suite, such as Word, PowerPoint and Outlook. App launcher can be used to switch seamlessly between the Office 365 applications.\nTabs\nThe tab is a menu with sub divisions sorted into groups. The tabs allow users to quickly navigate between options of menus which display different groups of functionality.\nGroups\nThe groups are sets of related commands. The groups are separated by the thin vertical line break.\nCommands\nThe commands are the buttons that you use to do actions.\nNow, let's have a look at the\nSheet\n. Soon you will be able to understand the relationship between the\nRibbon\nand the\nSheet\n, and you can make things happen.\nThe Sheet explained\nThe\nSheet\nis a set of rows and columns. It forms the same pattern as we have in math exercise books, the rectangle boxes formed by the pattern are called cells.\nValues can be typed to cells.\nValues can be both numbers and letters:\n1\tHello World\nCopy Values\nEach cell has its unique reference, which is its coordinates, this is where the columns and rows intersect.\nLet's break this up and explain by an example\nHave a look at the picture below. Hello world was typed in cell\nC4\n. The reference can be found by clicking on the relevant cell and seeing the reference in the\nName Box\nto the left, which tells you that the cell's reference is\nC4\n.\nAnother way to find the reference is to first find the column, in this case\nC\n, then map that towards the row, in this case\n4\n, which gives us the reference of\nC4\n.\nNote:\nThe reference of the cell is its coordinates. For example,\nC4\nhas the coordinates of column\nC\nand row\n4\n. You find the cell in the intersection of the two. The letter is always the column and the number is always the row.\nMultiple Sheets\nYou start with one\nSheet\nby default when you create a new workbook. You can have many sheets in a workbook. New sheets can be added and removed. Sheets can be named to making it easier to work with data sets.\nAre you up for the challenge?\nLet's create two new sheets and give them useful names.\nFirst, click the plus icon, shown in the picture below, create two new sheets:\nTip:\nYou can use the hotkey\nShift + F11\nto create new sheets. Try it!\nSecond, right click with your mouse on the relevant sheet and click rename:\nThird, enter useful names for the three sheets:\nIn this example we used the names\nData Visualization\n,\nData Structure\nand\nRaw Data\n. This is a typical structure when you are working with data.\nGood job!\nYou have now created your first workbook with three named sheets!\nChapter Summary\nThe workbook has two main components: the\nRibbon\nand the\nSheet\n.\nThe\nRibbon\nis used to navigate and access commands.\nThe\nSheet\nis made up of columns and rows, which make cells.\nEach cell has its unique reference. You can add new sheets to your workbook and name them.\nIn the\n\n\u2605\n+1",
