      "content": "Excel Filter\nFilters can be applied to sort and hide data. It makes data analysis easier.\nNote:\nFilter is similar to formatting a table, but it can be applied and deactivated.\nThe menu is accessed in the default Ribbon view or in the\nData\nsection in the navigation bar.\nApplying Filter\nFilters are applied by selecting a range and clicking the\nFilter\ncommand.\nIt is important to have a row of headers when applying filters. Having headers is useful to make the data understandable.\nNote:\nFilters are applied to the top row in a range.\nLike in the example below, the dedicated row is row\n1\n.\nID#\tName\tType 1\tType 2\tTotal\n1\tBulbasaur\tGrass\tPoison\t318\n2\tIvysaur\tGrass\tPoison\t405\n3\tVenusaur\tGrass\tPoison\t525\n4\tCharmander\tFire\t\t309\n5\tCharmeleon\tFire\t\t405\n6\tCharizard\tFire\tFlying\t534\n7\tSquirtle\tWater\t\t314\n8\tWartortle\tWater\t\t405\n9\tBlastoise\tWater\t\t530\n10\tCaterpie\tBug\t\t195\n11\tMetapod\tBug\t\t205\n12\tButterfree\tBug\tFlying\t395\n13\tWeedle\tBug\tPoisoin\t195\n14\tKakuna\tBug\tPoison\t205\n15\tBeedrill\tBug\tPoison\t395\n16\tPidgey\tNormal\tFlying\t251\n17\tPidgeotto\tNormal\tFlying\t349\n18\tPidgeot\tNormal\tFlying\t479\n19\tRattata\tNormal\t\t253\n20\tRaticate\tNormal\t\t413\nCopy Values\nLet's apply filters to the data set, step by step.\nSelect range\nA1:E1\nClick the\nSort & Filter\nmenu\nClick the\nFilter\ncommand\nNew buttons have been added to the cells in the top row. This indicates that the\nFilter\nwas successfully applied. The buttons can be clicked to access the different\nSort & Filter\noptions.\nA Non-Working Example\nLets delete row\n1\n(the header row) and apply filters to the new row\n1\n, to see what happens.\nThe filter is applied and has replaced the header row. It is important to dedicate a header row for the filter.\nFilter options\nThe filter options allow for sorting and filtering.\nApplying filter keeps the relationship between the columns while sorting and filtering.\nClicking the options button opens the menu.\nSorting\nRanges can be sorted and the relationship between the columns is kept.\nSort Ascending (A-Z)\nsorted from smallest to largest.\nSort Descending (Z-A)\nsorts from largest to smallest.\nYou can read more about Sorting in a \nchapter\n.\nFiltering\nFilters can be applied to hide and sort data.\nThis is helpful for analysis, to select the data that you want to see or not.\nExample Filter\nUse the filter option to filter on Pokemon that is\nType 1, Bug\n.\nStep by step\nClick the drop down menu on\nC1\n(\n) and choose the\nFilter\noption. This is the Column which holds the\nType 1\ndata.\nNote:\n\"Items\" are the different categories in that column; Grass, Fire, Water and so on.\nAll items are checked by default. The checked items are the ones that are shown. Uncheck to hide.\nUncheck all items, except\nBug\n, which is the type that we want to show.\nClick OK\nGood job!\nThe range was successfully sorted by\nType 1, Bug\n. All shown Pokemons are\nBug\ntype.\nNote:\nThe unchecked rows are hidden, not deleted.\nThis is explained by looking at the row numbers. The numbers are jumping from 1 to 11 and 16 to 22. The rows in between are hidden.\nNote:\nChecking the items will have the rows shown again.\nAnother Example\nUse the filter option to filter the Pokemons which have\nType 1\n,\nBug\nand\nType 2\n,\nPoison\n.\nClick the filter option in\nD1\nUncheck all items except\nPoison\nclick\nOK\nThat is on point!\nWe have sorted the range based on\nType 1\n,\nBug\nand\nType 2\n,\nPoison\n. The filter option is helpful to make ranges easier to analyse.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
