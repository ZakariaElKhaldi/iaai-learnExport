Double click the cells to type values into them. Go ahead and type:\nA1(309)\nA2(320)\nB1(39)\nB2(35)\nCompare with the picture shown below:\n309\t39\n320\t35\nCopy Values\nNote:\nType values by selecting a cell, claim it by entering the equal sign (\n=\n) \nand then type your value. For example\n=309\n.\nWell done!\nYou have successfully typed values to cells and now we can use them to create formulas.\nHere is how to do it, step by step.\nSelect the cell\nC1\nType the equal sign (\n=\n)\nLeft click on\nA1\n, the cell that has the\n(309)\nvalue\nType the minus sign (\n-\n)\nLeft click on\nB2\n, the cell that has the\n(35)\nvalue\nHit enter\nTip:\nThe formula can be typed directly without clicking the cells. The typed formula would be the same as the value in\nC1\n(=A1-B2)\n.\nThe result after hitting the enter button is\nC1(274)\n. Did you make it?\nAnother Example\nLet's try one more example, this time let's make the formula\n=A2-B1\n.\nHere is how to do it, step by step.\nSelect the cell\nC2\nType the equal sign (\n=\n)\nLeft click\nA2\n, the cell that has the\n(320)\nvalue\nType the minus sign (\n-\n)\nLeft click\nB1\n, the cell that has the\n(39)\nvalue\nHit the enter button\nYou got the result\nC2(281)\n, right?\nWay to go!\nNote:\nYou can make formulas with all four arithmetic operations, such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*) and division (/).\nHere are some examples:\n=2+4 gives you 6\n=4-2 gives you 2\n=2*4 gives you 8\n=2/4 gives you 0.5\nIn the \nRanges\nand how data \ncan be moved in the\nSheet\n.\nTest Yourself With Exercises\nExcel Exercise:\nComplete the Excel formula:\n1+1\nSubmit Answer \u00bb\nStart the Exercise\n\n\u2605\n+1",
