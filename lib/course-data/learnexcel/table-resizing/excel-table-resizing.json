      "content": "Table Resizing\nThe size of a table can be changed.\nResizing is to increase or decrease the range of the table.\nThere are three ways to resize a table\nResize table command\nDrag to resize\nAdding headers\nNote:\nResizing will continue formatting and formulas. This will be covered in a later chapter.\nResize Table Command\nThe resize table command allows you to change the size of the table by entering a range.\nFor example by entering\nA1:D10\n.\nThe command is found in the Ribbon under the Table Design tab.\nExample - Resizing a Table\nName\tType 1\tType 2\tHP\tAttack\tDefense\n    Abra\tPsychic\t\t25\t20\t15\n    Kadabra\tPsychic\t\t40\t35\t30\n    Alakazam\tPsychic\t\t55\t50\t45\n    Machop\tFighting\t\t70\t80\t50\n    Machoke\tFighting\t\t80\t100\t70\n    Machamp\tFighting\t\t90\t130\t80\n    Bellsprout\tGrass\tPoison\t50\t75\t35\n    Weepinbell\tGrass\tPoison\t65\t90\t50\n    Victreebel\tGrass\tPoison\t80\t105\t65\n    Tentacool\tWater\tPoison\t40\t40\t35\n    Tentacruel\tWater\tPoison\t80\t70\t65\nCopy Values\nConvert the range into a table.\nLets resize the table from range\nA1:F12\nto\nA1:F20\nSelect the table\nClick the Table Design menu\nClick the Resize Table command (\n)\nClicking the Resize Table command allows you to set a new range for the table.\nClick the range input field\nType the new range,\nA1:F20\nClick OK\nGreat!\nThe table has been resized to from\nA1:F12\nto\nA1:F20\n.\nDrag to Resize\nThe table can be resized by dragging its corner.\nExample - Dragging to Resize, Smaller\nChange the tables size from\nA1:F12\nto\nA1:D5\nPress and hold the bottom right corner of the table (\n)\nMove the pointer, marking the range\nA1:D5\nThe table range has been changed from\nA1:F12\nto\nA1:D5\n.\nNote:\nCells outside of the table range are no longer included in the table. The connection between the cells created by the table is broken and they no longer have the table formatting.\nLet's try to sort the Pokemon by their names to see what happens.\nClick the filter option in\nA1\nSort by Ascending (A-Z)\nThe filter option only includes the Pokemon in the tables range (\nA1:A5\n). The connection to the cells outside of the table is broken.\nLets resize again, this time bigger.\nExample - Dragging to Resize, Bigger\nChange the tables size from\nA1:D5\nto\nA1:G13\nPress and hold the bottom right corner of the table (\n)\nMove the pointer to mark\nA1:G13\nThe table range has been changed from\nA1:D5\nto\nA1:G13\n.\nThe rest of the cells are now included again, and the connection between the cells is back.\nLet's try to filter the Pokemon by their names to see what happens.\nClick the filter option in\nA1\nSort by Ascending (A-Z)\nNice!\nThe table has successfully sorted the Pokemon in the range\nA1:A12\nby their names.\nOh wait. Something has changed. A new column (\nG\n) has appeared...\nIncreasing the table size will continue the formatting, formulas and add new columns.\nNote:\nIt  will not overwrite the name for existing headers. It will use the value that is typed in the header cell.\nThe header name can be changed.\nDouble click\nG1\nDelete the text\nType \"Mighty\" to\nG1\nAnother Example - Resize By Adding Columns\nThe table is automatically increased when new headers \nType \"Mew\" to\nH1\nHit enter\nType \"Two\" to\nI1\nHit enter\nNew columns with appropriate rows are automatically added when new headers are typed.\nIn the\n\n\u2605\n+1",
