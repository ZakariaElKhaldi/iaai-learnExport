You will practice the skills that you have learned in the earlier chapters.\nCopy values or type the following data:\nItem\tItem price\tPrice   \tShop cart\t\nPokeball\t200\t\nGreat ball\t600\nUltra ball\t1200\nPotion\t300\nSuper potion\t700\t\nHyper potion\t1200\nAntidote\t100\n\nSubtotal\t\t\t\t\nDiscount\t\t\t\tDiscount\n\nTotal\nCopy Values\nTo solve the case we need to complete the following:\nPrices for items (\nC2:C8\n)\nSub total (\nB10\n)\nAdd discount (\nB11\n)\nTotal price (\nB13\n)\nAre you ready?\nStart by creating the first formula for\nItem price*Shop\ncart. We want the price to change when we change items in the Shop cart. Use the fill function on the range\nD2:D8\nafterwards to save time.\nStep by step:\nSelect\nC2\n, type (\n=\n)\nSelect\nB2\nType (\n*\n)\nSelect\nD2\nHit enter\nTest the formula by Typing\nD2(1)\n:\nDid you get\nC2(200)\n? That matches the price for one Pokeball!\nGood job!\nWe need the same formula for\nC2:C8\n, let's fill it downwards!\nNote:\nWe need relative references as we want the fill function to continue the formula to the \nFill\nD2:D8\nto double check the prices:\nThat looks right!\nLet us find the subtotal by using the\nSUM\nfunction on the\nC2:C8\nrange.\nType\nB10(=SUM)\nDouble click the\nSUM\nfunction\nMark the range\nC2:C8\nHit enter\nWell done!\nYou have successfully calculated the subtotal using the\nSUM\nfunction.\n\n10%\ndiscount. Type\nF11(10)\n:\nApply the discount to the subtotal:\nSelect\nB11\n, type (\n=\n)\nType\n(F11/100)*B10\nHit enter\nNote:\nThe\n(F11/100)\nwas used to change the value\n10\nto\n0.1\n, which is\n10%\n.\nSubtract the discount\nB11\nfrom the subtotal\nB10\nto calculate the total.\nSelect B13 type (\n=\n)\nSelect the minuend\nB10\nType (\n-\n)\nSelect the subtrahend\nB11\nHit enter\nThat is great!\nYou have completed all the tasks for the Poke Mart merchant.\nPrices for items\nRange\nC2:D8\ncalculates the prices by multiplying item price and shop cart\nSub total\nThe\nSUM\nfunction adds the range\nC2:C8\nAdd discount\nThe discount is calculated by using\nF11(10)\ninto the formula in\nB11\nTotal price\nTotal price is calculated by subtracting the discount from the subtotal\nTry changing the amounts in the shop cart and discount to see how the calculations adapt!\nCase completed!
