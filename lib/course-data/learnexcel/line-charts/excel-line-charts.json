      "content": "Line Charts\nLine charts show the data as a continuous line.\nLine charts are typically used for showing\ntrends\nover time.\nIn Line charts, the horizontal axis typically represents time.\nLine charts are used with data which can be placed in an order, from low to high.\nNote:\nData which can be placed in an order, from low to high, like numbers and letter grades from A to F are called\nordinal data\n. You can read more about ordinal data at\nStatistics - Measurement Levels.\nExcel has six types of line charts:\nLine (\n)\nLine with Markers (\n)\nStacked Line (\n)\nStacked Line with Markers (\n)\n100% Stacked Line (\n)\n100% Stacked Line with Markers (\n)\nLine\nLine charts are used for showing data ordered from low to high.\nExample\nLet's see the stats change for Bulbasaur evolutions.\nCopy the values to follow along:\nName\tHP\tAttack\tDefense\tSp. Atk\tSp. Def\tSpeed\n    Bulbasaur\t45\t49\t49\t65\t65\t45\n    Ivysaur\t60\t62\t63\t80\t80\t60\n    Venusaur\t80\t82\t83\t100\t100\t80\nCopy Values\nSelect the range\nA1:C4\nfor labels and data\nNote:\nThis menu is accessed by\nexpanding the ribbon\n.\nClick on the\nInsert\nmenu, then click on the Line menu (\n) and choose\nLine\n(\n) from the drop-down menu\nYou should get the chart below:\nThe chart gives a visual overview for the Pokemon stats.\nBulbasaur evolutions are shown on the horizontal axis.\nHP stat is shown in blue and Attack stat is shown in orange.\nThe chart shows that with each evolution, the stats increase.\nFantastic!\nNow let's plot more stats on the chart.\nSelect the range\nA1:D4\nfor labels and data\nClick on the\nInsert\nmenu, then click on Line menu (\n) and choose\nLine\n(\n) from the drop-down menu\nYou should get the chart below:\nWait a minute\n. Something doesn't seem right.\nSuddenly, Bulbasaur's evolutions are not shown on the horizontal axis. Instead, it is the stats.\nWhat's happening?\nNote:\nExcel checks the number of rows and columns included in the chart and automatically places the larger number on the horizontal axis.\nLuckily, there is a simple fix.\nClick on the the chart, then chick on the Chart tab and finally Click on Switch Row/Column.\nThe outcome is this chart which has Bulbasaur evolutions on the horizontal axis.\nLine with Markers\nLine with markers highlights data points with markers on a line chart.\nExample\nLet's chart the average HP, Attack and Defense over all the Pokemon generations.\nCopy the values to follow along:\nNote: This data is rounded to one decimal.\nGen\tAvg HP\tAvg Attack\tAvg Defense\n    Gen 1\t64,7\t73,9\t69,6\n    Gen 2\t70,6\t68,3\t69,5\n    Gen 3\t65,6\t75,8\t70,5\n    Gen 4\t72,6\t80,5\t77,3\n    Gen 5\t71,6\t82,2\t72,0\n    Gen 6\t68,5\t74,8\t76,3\nCopy Values\nSelect the range\nA1:D7\nfor labels and data\nNote:\nThis menu is accessed by\nexpanding the ribbon\n.\nClick on the\nInsert\nmenu, then click on the Line menu (\n) and choose\nLine with Markers\n(\n) from the drop-down menu\nYou should get the chart below:\nThe chart gives a visual overview for average Pokemon stats over generations.\nAverage HP is shown in blue, average attack is shown in orange and average defense is shown in gray.\nThe horizontal axis shows the generations.\nThis chart shows that the average of all stats in the 2nd generation is very close to each other and 5th generation Pokemon have on average the highest attack.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
