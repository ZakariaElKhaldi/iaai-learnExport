You can read more about ordinal data at\nStatistics - Measurement Levels.\nExample\nLet's see how the average stats add up across Pokemon generations\nCopy the values to follow along:\nNote: This data is rounded to one decimal.\nGen\tAvg HP\tAvg Attack\tAvg Defense\n    Gen 1\t64,7\t73,9\t69,6\n    Gen 2\t70,6\t68,3\t69,5\n    Gen 3\t65,6\t75,8\t70,5\n    Gen 4\t72,6\t80,5\t77,3\n    Gen 5\t71,6\t82,2\t72,0\n    Gen 6\t68,5\t74,8\t76,3\nCopy Values\nSelect the range\nA1:D7\nfor labels and data\nNote:\nThis menu is accessed by\nexpanding the ribbon\n.\nClick on the\nInsert\nmenu, then click on the Line menu (\n) and choose\n100% Stacked Line\n(\n) from the drop-down menu\nYou should get the chart below:\nThe chart gives a visual overview for the average Pokemon stats over generations.\nThe blue line shows how much the average HP contribute to the overall.
