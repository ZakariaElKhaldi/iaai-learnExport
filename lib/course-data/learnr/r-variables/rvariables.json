      "content": "Creating Variables in R\nVariables are containers for storing data values.\nR does not have a command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. To assign a value to a variable, use the\n<-\nsign. To output (or print) the variable value, just type the variable name:\nExample\nname <- \"John\"\nage <- 40\nname\u00a0\u00a0 # output \"John\"\nage\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 # output 40\n\nFrom the example above,\nname\nand\nage\nare\nvariables\n, while\n\"John\"\nand\n40\nare\nvalues\n.\nIn other programming language, it is common to use\n=\nas an assignment operator. In R, we can use\nboth\n=\nand\n<-\nas assignment operators.\nHowever,\n<-\nis preferred in most cases because the\n=\noperator can be forbidden in some contexts in R.\nPrint / Output Variables\nCompared to many other programming languages, you do not have to use a \nfunction to print/output variables in R. You can just type the name of the \nvariable:\nExample\nname <- \"John Doe\"\nname # auto-print the value of the name variable\n\nHowever, R does have a\nprint()\nfunction \navailable if you want to use it. This might be useful if you are familiar with other programming languages, such as\nPython\n, which \noften use a\nprint()\nfunction to output variables.\nExample\nname <- \"John Doe\"\nprint(name) # print the value of the name variable\n\nAnd there are times you must use the\nprint()\nfunction to output code, for example when working with\nfor\nloops (which you will learn more about in a later chapter):\nExample\nfor (x in 1:10) {\nprint(x)\n}\n\nConclusion:\nIt is up to your if you want to use the\nprint()\nfunction or not to output code. However, when your code is inside an R expression (for example inside curly braces\n{}\nlike in the example above), use the\nprint()\nfunction if you want to output the result.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
