      "content": "Recursion\nR also accepts function recursion, which means a defined function can call itself.\nRecursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself.\nThis has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.\nThe developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a\nfunction which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power.\nHowever, when written correctly, recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant\napproach to programming.\nIn this example,\ntri_recursion()\nis a function that we have defined to call itself (\"recurse\"). We use the\nk\nvariable as the data, which decrements (\n-1\n) every time we recurse. The recursion ends when the\ncondition is not greater than 0 (i.e. when it is 0).\nTo a new developer it can take some time to work out how exactly this works, best way to find out is\nby testing and modifying it.\nExample\ntri_recursion <- function(k) {\nif (k > 0) {\nresult <- k + tri_recursion(k - 1)\nprint(result)\n} else {\nresult = 0\nreturn(result)\n}\n}\ntri_recursion(6)\n\n\u2605\n+1",
