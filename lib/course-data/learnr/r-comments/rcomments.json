It can also be used to \nprevent execution when testing alternative code.\nComments starts with a\n#\n. When executing code, R will ignore anything \nthat starts with\n#\n.\nThis example uses a comment before a line of code:\nExample\n# This is a comment\n\"Hello World!\"\n\nThis example uses a comment at the end of a line of code:\nExample\n\"Hello World!\"\n  # This is a comment\n\nComments does not have to be text to explain the code, it can also be used to prevent R from\nexecuting the code:\nExample\n# \"Good morning!\"\n\"Good night!\"\n\nMultiline Comments\nUnlike other programming languages, such as\nJava\n, there are no syntax in R for multiline comments. However, we can just insert a\n#\nfor each line \nto create multiline comments:\nExample\n# This is a comment\n# written in\n# more than just one line\n\"Hello World!\"\n\n\u2605\n+1",
