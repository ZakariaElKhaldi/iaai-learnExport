Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.\nAlthough Hooks generally replace class components, there are no plans to remove classes from React.\nWhat is a Hook?\nHooks allow us to \"hook\" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods.\nExample:\nHere is an example of a Hook. Don't worry if it doesn't make sense. We will go into more detail in the\n\n.\nimport React, { useState } from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\";\n\nfunction FavoriteColor() {\n  const [color, setColor] = useState(\"red\");\n\nreturn (\n    <>\n      <h1>My favorite color is {color}!</h1>\n      <button\n        type=\"button\"\n        onClick={() => setColor(\"blue\")}\n      >Blue</button>\n      <button\n        type=\"button\"\n        onClick={() => setColor(\"red\")}\n      >Red</button>\n      <button\n        type=\"button\"\n        onClick={() => setColor(\"pink\")}\n      >Pink</button>\n      <button\n        type=\"button\"\n        onClick={() => setColor(\"green\")}\n      >Green</button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\nroot.render(<FavoriteColor />);\nRun \nExample \u00bb\nYou must\nimport\nHooks from\nreact\n.\nHere we are using the\nuseState\nHook to keep track of the application state.\nState generally refers to application data or properties that need to be tracked.\nHook Rules\nThere are 3 rules for hooks:\nHooks can only be called inside React function components.\nHooks can only be called at the top level of a component.\nHooks cannot be conditional\nNote:\nHooks will not work in React class components.\nCustom Hooks\nIf you have stateful logic that needs to be reused in several components, you can build your own custom Hooks.\nWe'll go into more detail in the\nCustom Hooks section\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
