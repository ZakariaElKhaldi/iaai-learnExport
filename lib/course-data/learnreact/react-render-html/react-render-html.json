This is where our React application will be rendered.\nExample\nDisplay a paragraph inside an element with the id of \"root\":\nconst container = document.getElementById('root');\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);\nroot.render(<p>Hello</p>);\nThe result is displayed in the\n<div id=\"root\">\nelement:\n<body>\n  <div id=\"root\"></div>\n</body>\nRun \nExample \u00bb\nNote that the element id does not have to be called \"root\", but this is the standard convention.\nThe HTML Code\nThe HTML code in this tutorial uses JSX which allows you to write HTML tags \ninside the JavaScript code:\nDo not worry if the syntax is unfamiliar, you will learn more about JSX in the \nExample\nCreate a variable that contains HTML code and display it in the \"root\" node:\nconst myelement = (\n  <table>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Name</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>John</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Elsa</td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n);\n\nconst container = document.getElementById('root');\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);\nroot.render(myelement);\nRun \nExample \u00bb\nThe Root Node\nThe root node is the HTML element where you want to display the result.\nIt is like a\ncontainer\nfor content managed by React.\nIt does NOT have to be a\n<div>\nelement and it does \nNOT have to \nhave the\nid='root'\n:\nExample\nThe root node can be called whatever you like:\n<body>\n\n<header id=\"sandy\"></header>\n\n</body>\nDisplay the result in the\n<header id=\"sandy\">\nelement:\nconst container = document.getElementById('sandy');\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);\nroot.render(<p>Hallo</p>);\nRun \nExample \u00bb\n\n\u2605\n+1",
