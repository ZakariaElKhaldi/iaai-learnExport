      "content": "The React\nuseState\nHook allows us to track state in a function component.\nState generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.\nImport\nuseState\nTo use the\nuseState\nHook, we first need to\nimport\nit into our component.\nExample:\nAt the top of your component,\nimport\nthe\nuseState\nHook.\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nNotice that we are destructuring\nuseState\nfrom\nreact\nas it is a named export.\nTo learn more about destructuring, check out the\nES6 section\n.\nInitialize\nuseState\nWe initialize our state by calling\nuseState\nin our function component.\nuseState\naccepts an initial state and returns two values:\nThe current state.\nA function that updates the state.\nExample:\nInitialize state at the top of the function component.\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\n\nfunction FavoriteColor() {\n  const [color, setColor] = useState(\"\");\n}\nNotice that again, we are destructuring the returned values from\nuseState\n.\nThe first value,\ncolor\n, is our current state.\nThe second value,\nsetColor\n, is the function that is used to update our state.\nThese names are variables that can be named anything you would like.\nLastly, we set the initial state to an empty string:\nuseState(\"\")\nRead State\nWe can now include our state anywhere in our component.\nExample:\nUse the state variable in the rendered component.\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\";\n\nfunction FavoriteColor() {\n  const [color, setColor] = useState(\"red\");\n\nreturn <h1>My favorite color is {color}!</h1>\n}\n\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\nroot.render(<FavoriteColor />);\nRun \nExample \u00bb\nUpdate State\nTo update our state, we use our state updater function.\nWe should never directly update state. Ex:\ncolor = \"red\"\nis not allowed.\nExample:\nUse a button to update the state:\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\";\n\nfunction FavoriteColor() {\n  const [color, setColor] = useState(\"red\");\n\nreturn (\n    <>\n      <h1>My favorite color is {color}!</h1>\n      <button\n        type=\"button\"\n        onClick={() => setColor(\"blue\")}\n      >Blue</button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\nroot.render(<FavoriteColor />);\nRun \nExample \u00bb\nWhat Can State Hold\nThe\nuseState\nHook can be used to keep track of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and any combination of these!\nWe could create multiple state Hooks to track individual values.\nExample:\nCreate multiple state Hooks:\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\";\n\nfunction Car() {\n  const [brand, setBrand] = useState(\"Ford\");\n  const [model, setModel] = useState(\"Mustang\");\n  const [year, setYear] = useState(\"1964\");\n  const [color, setColor] = useState(\"red\");\n\nreturn (\n    <>\n      <h1>My {brand}</h1>\n      <p>\n        It is a {color} {model} from {year}.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\nroot.render(<Car />);\nRun \nExample \u00bb\nOr, we can just use one state and include an object instead!\nExample:\nCreate a single Hook that holds an object:\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\";\n\nfunction Car() {\n  const [car, setCar] = useState({\n    brand: \"Ford\",\n    model: \"Mustang\",\n    year: \"1964\",\n    color: \"red\"\n  });\n\nreturn (\n    <>\n      <h1>My {car.brand}</h1>\n      <p>\n        It is a {car.color} {car.model} from {car.year}.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\nroot.render(<Car />);\nRun \nExample \u00bb\nSince we are now tracking a single object,\nwe need to reference that object and then the property of that object when rendering the component.\n(Ex:\ncar.brand\n)\nUpdating Objects and Arrays in State\nWhen state is updated, the entire state gets overwritten.\nWhat if we only want to update the color of our car?\nIf we only called\nsetCar({color: \"blue\"})\n, this would remove the brand, model, and year from our state.\nWe can use the JavaScript spread operator to help us.\nExample:\nUse the JavaScript spread operator to update only the color of the car:\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\";\n\nfunction Car() {\n  const [car, setCar] = useState({\n    brand: \"Ford\",\n    model: \"Mustang\",\n    year: \"1964\",\n    color: \"red\"\n  });\n\nconst updateColor = () => {\n    setCar(\n      return { ...\n    });\n  }\n\nreturn (\n    <>\n      <h1>My {car.brand}</h1>\n      <p>\n        It is a {car.color} {car.model} from {car.year}.\n      </p>\n      <button\n        type=\"button\"\n        onClick={updateColor}\n      >Blue</button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\nroot.render(<Car />);\nRun \nExample \u00bb\nBecause we need the current value of state, we pass a function into our\nsetCar\nfunction.\nThis function receives the \nWe then return an object, spreading the\n\nand overwriting only the color.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
