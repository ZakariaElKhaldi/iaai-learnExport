In-line individually, or all at once at the bottom.\nExample\nIn-line individually:\nperson.js\nexport const name = \"Jesse\"\nexport const age = 40\nAll at once at the bottom:\nperson.js\nconst name = \"Jesse\"\nconst age = 40\n\nexport { name, age }\nDefault Exports\nLet us create another file, named\nmessage.js\n, and \nuse it for demonstrating default export.\nYou can only have one default export in a file.\nExample\nmessage.js\nconst message = () => {\n  const name = \"Jesse\";\n  const age = 40;\n  return name + ' is ' + age + 'years old.';\n};\n\nexport default message;\nImport\nYou can import modules into a file in two ways, based on if they are named \nexports or default exports.\nNamed exports must be destructured using curly braces. Default exports do not.\nExample\nImport named exports from the file person.js:\nimport { name, age } from \"./person.js\";\n\nExample\nImport a default export from the file message.js:\nimport message from \"./message.js\";\n\n\u2605\n+1",
