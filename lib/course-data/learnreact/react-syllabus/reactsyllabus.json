      "content": "Introduction\nThe\n React Tutorial\nis comprehensive and beginner-friendly.\nIt will give you a fundamental knowledge of React.\nIt is designed for beginners and requires intermediate JavaScript knowledge.\nThe content has been carefully made to be bite-sized, simple, and easy to understand.\nThe content has been proven by millions of users over the years. It is updated and improved frequently.\nThe syllabus outline and its sequence are structured so you can learn React step by step, from basic components to advanced features.\nGet Started With React \u00bb\nLearning Outcomes\nMaster ES6 features used in React (classes, arrow functions, destructuring, modules).\nCreate and render React components using JSX syntax.\nWork with React components, both class and functional components.\nHandle component props and state management.\nImplement event handling and conditional rendering.\nCreate and manage lists with keys in React.\nBuild forms and handle user input in React applications.\nImplement navigation using React Router.\nUse React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useRef, etc.).\nApply performance optimization with React Memo.\nStyle React components using CSS and Sass.\nCreate custom hooks for reusable logic.\nNote:\nAre you a teacher teaching React?\n Academy\nis a toolbox of features that can help you teach. It offers classroom features such as pre-built study plans, classroom administration and much more. Read more about\nAcademy here\n.\nWhich Subjects Are React Relevant For?\nWeb Development:\nReact can be used for building modern web applications.\nFront-end Development:\nReact is a leading library for user interface development.\nSingle Page Applications:\nReact enables building dynamic single-page applications.\nUser Interface Design:\nReact provides a component-based approach to UI development.\nWeb Applications:\nReact is ideal for interactive web applications.\nMobile Development:\nReact Native extends React concepts to mobile development.\nModern JavaScript Development:\nReact embraces modern JavaScript features and practices.\nGet Started\nActivities\nIn this tutorial we offer different activities for you to learn React for free:\nLessons\nExercises\nQuizzes\nSign in to Track Progress\nYou can also create a free account to \nAs a signed-in user, you get access to features such as:\nLearning paths\nSandbox and lab environments\nAchievements\nAnd much more!\n\nOverview of the Modules\nReact Home\nReact Intro\nReact Get Started\nReact Upgrade\nReact ES6\nES6 Classes\nES6 Arrow Functions\nES6 Variables\nES6 Array Methods\nES6 Destructuring\nES6 Spread Operator\nES6 Modules\nES6 Ternary Operator\nReact Render HTML\nReact JSX\nReact Components\nReact Class\nReact Props\nReact Events\nReact Conditionals\nReact Lists\nReact Forms\nReact Router\nReact Memo\nReact CSS Styling\nReact Sass Styling\nWhat is a Hook?\nuseState\nuseEffect\nuseContext\nuseRef\nuseReducer\nuseCallback\nuseMemo\nCustom Hooks\nGet Started\nSandbox and Lab Environment\nReact, like any programming library, is best learned through hands-on practice.\nTry this example using our editor:\nExample:\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';\n\nfunction Hello(props) {\n  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;\n}\n\nconst container = document.getElementById(\"root\");\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);\nroot.render(<Hello />);\nRun \nExample \u00bb\nIf you want to explore more and host your project, we have a feature called\nSpaces\nthat allows you to build, test and deploy static websites for free.\nHere you get a secure sandbox environment called Spaces, where you can practice coding and test projects in real-time.\nSpaces allow you to test, build, and deploy code. This includes a  subdomain, hosting, and secure SSL certificates.\nSpaces require no installation and run directly in the browser.\nFeatures include:\nCollaboration\nFile navigator\nTerminal & log\nPackage manager\nDatabase\nEnvironment manager\nAnalytics\nCreate a Spaces Account\nReact Certification\n offers an end-of-pathway certification program.\nHere you can take exams to get certified.\nThe React exam is a test that summarizes the  React syllabus.\nAfter passing the exam you get the \"Certified React Developer\" Certification.\nThere are two different types of certifications:\nNon-adaptive\nAdaptive\nThe non-adaptive is pass or no pass.\nThe adaptive certification is adaptive and graded; students will get a grade from intermediate, advanced to professional.\nBuy Certificate \u00bb\nAre You a Teacher?\nAre you interested in learning how you can use\n Academy\nto Teach \nReact?\nWatch a demo of\n Academy\n. You'll see how it works, and discover how it can make teaching programming easier and more engaging.\nWatch Demo \u00bb\n\n\u2605\n+1",
