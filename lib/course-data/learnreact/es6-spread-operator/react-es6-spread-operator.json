      "content": "Spread Operator\nThe JavaScript spread operator (\n...\n) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.\nExample\nconst numbersOne = [1, 2, 3];\nconst numbersTwo = [4, 5, 6];\nconst numbersCombined = [...numbersOne, ...numbersTwo];\n\nThe spread operator is often used in combination with destructuring.\nExample\nAssign the first and second items from\nnumbers\nto variables and put the rest in an array:\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];\n\nconst [one, two, ...rest] = numbers;\n\nWe can use the spread operator with objects too:\nExample\nCombine these two objects:\nconst myVehicle = {\n  brand: 'Ford',\n  model: 'Mustang',\n  color: 'red'\n}\n\nconst updateMyVehicle = {\n  type: 'car',\n  year: 2021, \n  color: 'yellow'\n}\n\nconst myUpdatedVehicle = {...myVehicle, ...updateMyVehicle}\n\nNotice the properties that did not match were combined, but the property that did match,\ncolor\n, was overwritten by the last object that was passed,\nupdateMyVehicle\n. The resulting color is now yellow.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
