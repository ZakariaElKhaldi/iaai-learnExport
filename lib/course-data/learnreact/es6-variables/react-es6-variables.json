      "content": "Variables\nBefore ES6 there was only one way of defining your variables: with the\nvar\nkeyword. If you did not define them, they would be assigned to the \nglobal object. Unless you were in strict mode, then you would get an error if \nyour variables were undefined.\nNow, with ES6, there are three ways of defining your variables:\nvar\n,\nlet\n, and\nconst\n.\nExample\nvar\nvar x = 5.6;\nIf you use\nvar\noutside of a function, it belongs to the global scope.\nIf you use\nvar\ninside of a function, it belongs to that function.\nIf you use\nvar\ninside of a block, i.e. a for loop, the \nvariable is still available outside of that block.\nvar\nhas a\nfunction\nscope, not a\nblock\nscope.\nExample\nlet\nlet x = 5.6;\nlet\nis the block scoped version of\nvar\n, and is limited to the block (or expression) where it is defined.\nIf you use\nlet\ninside of a block, i.e. a for loop, the \nvariable is only available inside of that loop.\nlet\nhas a\nblock\nscope.\nExample\nconst\nconst x = 5.6;\nconst\nis a variable that once it has been \ncreated, its value can never change.\nconst\nhas a\nblock\nscope.\nThe keyword\nconst\nis a bit misleading.\nIt does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.\nBecause of this you can NOT:\nReassign a constant value\nReassign a constant array\nReassign a constant object\nBut you CAN:\nChange the elements of constant array\nChange the properties of constant object\n\n\u2605\n+1",
