      "content": "Data types are the types of data that can be stored in a variable.\nWhat is a Data Type?\nA data type is the type of data a variable has, like is it a text or is it a number?\nThe data type we set a variable to affects what we can do with the variable.\nFor example, if we have two variables of a number data type, with values\n3\nand\n4\n, we can use the\n+\noperator to add them together, and we get\n7\n:\na = 3\nb = 4\nprint(a + b)\nconst a = 3;\nconst b = 4;\nconsole.log(a + b);\nint a = 3;\nint b = 4;\nSystem.out.println(a + b);\nint a = 3;\nint b = 4;\ncout << a + b;\nRun Example \u00bb\nBut, if we store the two values as text string data types instead, as\n\"3\"\nand\n\"4\"\n, we get\n\"34\"\nas the result when we use the\n+\noperator:\na = \"3\"\nb = \"4\"\nprint(a + b)\nconst a = \"3\";\nconst b = \"4\";\nconsole.log(a + b);\nString a = \"3\";\nString b = \"4\";\nSystem.out.println(a + b);\nstring a = \"3\";\nstring b = \"4\";\ncout << a + b;\nRun Example \u00bb\nWhat data types you have available depends on the programming language you are using, but the most common data types are:\nString (text)\nInteger (whole number)\nFloat (decimal number)\nBoolean (true or false)\nIn Python and JavaScript, we don't specify the data type when the variable is created, because that happens automatically, but in Java and C++, we need to specify the data type when creating a variable.\nFinding the Data Type of a Variable\nIf you have a variable, and you want to find out what data type it is, most programming languages have a built-in function you can use for that.\nIn the code example below, we store the value\n3\nin a variable named\nx\n, and check what type of data it is.\nx = 3\nprint(type(x))\nconst x = 3;\nconsole.log(typeof x);\nint x = 3;\nSystem.out.println(x.getClass().getName());\nint x = 3;\ncout << typeid(x).name();\nRun Example \u00bb\nIn the example above, it is very obvious that the variable\nx\nis an integer (a whole number). But in more complex situations, like when\nx\nis an argument to a function, it might be important to check what type of data it is before we use it inside the function.\nString Data Type\nA string is a sequence of characters.\nIn Python and JavaScript, a string is enclosed in either double quotes\n\"Hello\"\nor single quotes\n'Hello'\n.\nBut in Java and C++, strings must be enclosed in double quotes\n\"Hello\"\n, and they have a separate character data type, where single quotes are used\n'H'\n.\nThis is how a value\n\"Hello, World!\"\n, of data type string, is assigned to a variable\nmessage\n:\nmessage = 'Hello, World!'\nconst message = 'Hello, World!';\nString message = \"Hello, World!\";\nstring message = \"Hello, World!\";\nRun Example \u00bb\nFor strings, the\n+\noperator is used to concatenate two strings, merging them into one.\na = 'Hello, '\nb = 'World!'\nmessage = a + b\nconst a = 'Hello, ';\nconst b = 'World!';\nconst message = a + b;\nString a = \"Hello, \";\nString b = \"World!\";\nString message = a + b;\nstring a = \"Hello, \";\nstring b = \"World!\";\nstring message = a + b;\nRun Example \u00bb\nInteger Data Type\nAn integer is a whole number, like\n1\n,\n27\n,\n-3\n, etc.\nThis is how a value\n7\n, of data type integer, is assigned to a variable\na\n:\na = 7\nconst a = 7;\nint a = 7;\nint a = 7;\nRun Example \u00bb\nWhen dealing with integers, the\n+\noperator is used to add two integers together mathematically:\na = 7\nb = 4\nc = a + b\nconst a = 7;\nconst b = 4;\nconst c = a + b;\nint a = 7;\nint b = 4;\nint c = a + b;\nint a = 7;\nint b = 4;\nint c = a + b;\nRun Example \u00bb\nOther mathematical operations can also be performed with integers, using operators like\n-\n,\n*\n,\n/\n, etc.\nFloat Data Type\nA float is a decimal number, like\n3.14\n,\n-0.001\n,\n2.71828\n, etc.\nThis is how a value\n3.14\n, of data type float, is assigned to a variable\npi\n:\npi = 3.14\nconst pi = 3.14;\ndouble pi = 3.14f;\ndouble pi = 3.14;\nRun Example \u00bb\nThe same kind of mathematical operations can be performed with floats as with the integer data type, using operators like\n-\n,\n*\n,\n/\n,\n+\n, etc.\nBoolean Data Type\nA Boolean is a data type that can only have two values:\nTrue\nor\nFalse\n.\n\"Boolean\" is written with a capital \"B\" because it is named after a person: George Boole.\nThis is how a value\nTrue\n, of data type Boolean, is assigned to a variable\na\n:\na = True\nconst a = true;\nboolean a = true;\nbool a = true;\nRun Example \u00bb\nA Boolean value is what we get as a result of a comparison between two values, using a comparison operator, like this:\na = 5\nb = 3\naIsBigger = a > b\nconst a = 5;\nconst b = 3;\nconst aIsBigger = a > b;\nint a = 5;\nint b = 3;\nboolean aIsBigger = a > b;\nint a = 5;\nint b = 3;\nbool aIsBigger = a > b;\nRun Example \u00bb\nIn the code above, since\na\nis greater than\nb\n, the variable\naIsBigger\nwill be assigned the value\nTrue\n.\nCasting Data Types\nCasting is the process of converting a value from one data type to another.\nThis is done using functions specific to the programming language we are using.\nFor example, if we have a string variable\na\nthat contains a number\n\"18\"\n, we must cast it to an integer before we can use it in calculations, like this:\na = '18'\nb = int(a) + 3\nconst a = '18';\nconst b = parseInt(a) + 3;\nString a = \"18\";\nint b = Integer.parseInt(a) + 3;\nstring a = \"18\";\nint b = stoi(a) + 3;\nRun Example \u00bb\nNone, or Null\nWe assign\nNone\n, or\nnull\n, to a variable to indicate that it has no value.\nThis is how a variable can be assigned\nNone\n, or\nnull\n:\na = None\nprint(a)\nprint(type(a))\nconst a = null;\nconsole.log(a);\nconsole.log(typeof a);\nString s = null;\nSystem.out.println(s);\nint* ptr = nullptr;\n\nif (ptr == nullptr) {\n  cout << \"ptr is nullptr\";\n}\nRun Example \u00bb\nIn\nJava\n, the\nnull\nkeyword can only be assigned to\nnon-primitive data type\nvariables, like strings or arrays.\nC++\ndoes not have a direct equivalent to\nnull\n, or\nNone\n, but the\nnullptr\nkeyword can be used to indicate that a\npointer\npoints to nothing.\nBinary Values and Data Types\nIn computers, all data is stored as sequences of\n0\ns and\n1\ns.\nThe computer needs to know the data type of the data stored to interpret it correctly, and to present it to the user in the right way.\nSo for example, the same binary sequence\n1000001\nstored in the computer, can be interpreted as either the number\n65\n, or the character\nA\n, depending on the data type we choose.\nClick the\n0\ns and\n1\ns in the simulation below to see how different sequences of bits can be interpreted as either a decimal number or a character.\nDecimal:\n{{ resultingDecimal }}\nCharacter:\n{{ resultingCharacter }}\nBinary:\n{{ bit }}\nControl characters\nare characters that are not printable, and are shown as\n<control>\nin the simulation above. Such characters are used to control the computer, to tell the computer \"here comes a new line\" for example.\nA simple\nASCII\n/\nUTF-8\ncharacter set is used to interpret the binary sequences in the simulation above, which means we use only the first 7 bits, or the 128 first positions of the character set.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
