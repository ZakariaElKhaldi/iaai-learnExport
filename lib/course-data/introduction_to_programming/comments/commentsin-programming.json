      "content": ",\ncomments\nare text notes in your code that are ignored by the computer.\nThey can help you and others understand what the code does.\nWhat is a Comment?\nA comment is a section in your code that is not executed.\nComments are used to explain, clarify, or comment code for yourself or others who may read it later.\nComments make code easier to read and maintain\nThey help document the purpose or logic of code sections\nThey can be used to temporarily disable code for debugging\nWhy Use Comments?\nGood comments make code understandable and maintainable.\nComments can:\nExplain complex logic\nDescribe the purpose of functions, classes, or files\nMark sections that need improvement\nMake collaboration with others easier\nDebug code by temporarily disabling lines or blocks\nTypes of Comments\nMost programming languages support several types of comments:\n1. Single-line Comments\nUsed for short explanations or notes.\nEither as a whole line:\n//this line is a comment\nprint(\"Hello\");\nor at the end of a line:\nprint(\"Hello\"); //this is a comment\n2. Multi-line Comments\nUsed for longer explanations. Syntax varies by language.\n/*This is a comment\nthat spans over\nmultiple lines*/\nprint(\"Hello\");\n3. Inline Comments\nComments can also appear\ninside\na line of code.\n    In languages that support multi-line comments, you can place a comment in the middle of a statement.\nThis is sometimes used to quickly change a value or logic for testing.\nfirstname = /*\"John\"*/\"Jane\";\nprint(\"Hello \" + firstname);\nNote:\nThis technique does\nnot\nwork in Python,\n    as Python does not support block comments inside statements.\nComments in Different Languages\nLanguage\nSingle-line\nMulti-line\nTry It\nPython\n# comment\n\"\"\" multi-line\ncomments \"\"\"\nTry it \u00bb\nJavaScript\n// comment\n/* multi-line\ncomments */\nTry it \u00bb\nJava\n// comment\n/* multi-line\ncomments */\nTry it \u00bb\nC\n// comment\n/* multi-line\ncomments */\nTry it \u00bb\nC++\n// comment\n/* multi-line\ncomments */\nTry it \u00bb\nHTML\n<!-- comment -->\n<!-- multi-line\ncomments -->\nTry it \u00bb",

When troubleshooting code, you can temporarily \"comment out\" lines or blocks to isolate problems or prevent certain code from running.\nComment out code:\nDisable parts of your code without deleting them, making it easy to restore later.\nTest changes safely:\nTry new logic while keeping the original code as comments for reference.\nIsolate bugs:\nBy commenting out sections, you can narrow down where errors are happening.\nDebugging Examples\n# Debugging by commenting out a line\nx = 10\ny = 0\n# y = 5\nresult = x + y\nprint(result)\n// Debugging by commenting out a line\nlet x = 10;\nlet y = 0;\n// y = 5;\nlet result = x + y;\nconsole.log(result);\n// Debugging by commenting out a line\n#include\nusing namespace std;\nint main() {\n  int x = 10;\n  int y = 0;\n  // y = 5;\n  int result = x + y;\n  cout << result << endl;\n  return 0;\n}\n// Debugging by commenting out a line\npublic class Main {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    int x = 10;\n    int y = 0;\n    // y = 5;\n    int result = x + y;\n    System.out.println(result);\n  }\n}\n<!-- Debugging by commenting out a line -->\n<!-- <p>This paragraph is temporarily hidden for debugging</p> -->\n<p>Hello, world!</p>\n-- Debugging by commenting out a line\n-- SELECT * FROM Cutomers;\nSELECT * FROM Products;\n# Debugging by commenting out a line\n# rm important_file.txt\necho \"Safe for now!\"\nTip:\nRemember to remove or update debugging comments before finalizing your code to keep it clean and maintainable.\nBest Practices for Comments\nWrite clear and concise comments\nKeep comments up-to-date with your code\nDon't state the obvious (avoid \"increment x by 1\" for\nx += 1\n)\nUse comments to explain\nwhy\n, not just\nwhat\nRemove outdated or misleading comments\nSummary\nComments are a vital tool for making your code readable, maintainable, and collaborative. Use them wisely!\n\n\u2605\n+1",
