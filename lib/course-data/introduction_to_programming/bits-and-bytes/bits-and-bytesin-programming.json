      "content": "Bits and bytes are the smallest units of data in a computer.\nA bit is a single binary digit, with a value of either 0 or 1.\nA byte is a group of 8 bits.\nWhat is a Bit?\nA bit is the smallest possible unit of data in a computer.\nOne bit holds a value of either\n0\nor\n1\n.\nBits are stored in different ways:\nIn\ncomputer memory\n, a bit is stored as electrical voltage, where a voltage above a certain threshold represents a\n1\n, and a voltage below that threshold represents a\n0\n.\nIn\nhard disk drives\n, a bit is stored as magnetism, where an area magnetized in one orientation represents a\n1\n, and a magnetized area in the opposite orientation represents a\n0\n.\nIn\nCDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs\n, a bit is stored as either a pit, or a flat area. A pit is an area where the surface is lower than the surrounding surface, and that represents a\n1\n. A flat area is when there is no pit, and that represents a\n0\n.\nBut simply storing just one bit is not very useful. We need to store more bits together to represent larger amounts of data.\nWhat is a Byte?\nA byte is a group of 8 bits, like\n10001011\nfor example.\nEach bit can be either\n0\nor\n1\n, and with 8 bits in a byte, there are 2\n8\n= 256 different values a byte can have.\nUsing one byte, we can store:\nA pixel with one out of 256 different colors.\nAn unsigned number from 0 to 255.\nA signed number from -128 to 127.\nA character from the\nASCII table\n.\nThis means that the specific byte\n10001011\ncould be:\nA pixel with a specific color.\nThe unsigned number 139.\nThe signed number -117 (the leftmost bit is\n1\n, which means it is a negative number).\nThe character\n<\n, from the extended ASCII table\nISO-8859-1\n.\nBut normally, modern computers use more than one byte to store a single character, number or color.\nLearn about\nbinary numbers\nto get a deeper understanding of how bits and bytes work.\nStoring Groups of Bytes\nLike we have seen, it is possible to use a single byte to store a single character, a number, or a color.\nBut normally, modern computers use more than one byte to store something.\nColors\nThis blue color\nfor example, is created with\nCSS code\nrgb(0,153,204)\n, and is stored using 3 bytes:\n00000000\n(0) for red color\n10011001\n(153) for green color\n11001100\n(204) for blue color\nColor codes for other colors can be found using\nthis color picker\n.\nUsing 3 bytes, we can store 2\n24\n= 16,777,216 different colors.\nCharacters\nStoring characters using\nUTF-8 encoding\n, a single character can be stored in 1 to 4 bytes.\nIn UTF-8, the letter\ng\nis stored using 1 byte as\n01100111\n, and the smiley emoji \ud83d\ude0a is stored using 4 bytes as\n11110000 10011111 10011000 10001010\n.\nUsing 1 to 4 bytes, we can store 1,112,064 different characters.\nNumbers\nStoring numbers that are either very large or in need of high precision, or both, requires a lot of data storage.\nFor example, storing the mathematical number pi\n\ud835\udf0b = 3.141592...\nin Python or JavaScript, requires 64 bits (following the IEEE 754 standard).\nUsing 64 bits to store numbers makes it possible to store large numbers, and numbers with a high precision, and that allows us to do very precise calculations.\nData Storage Units\nWhen storing data, we can use different units to measure the size of the data.\nIn data measurement units, the capital letter \"B\" is used to represent \"byte\", and the lower case letter \"b\" is used to represent \"bit\".\nStoring many bytes, we use units:\nBytes (B)\nKilobytes (kB)\nMegabytes (MB)\nGigabytes (GB)\nTerabytes (TB)\nThe International System of Units (SI) defines the prefixes:\nkilo- (k), meaning 1 000\nmega- (M), meaning 1 000 000\ngiga- (G), meaning 1 000 000 000\ntera- (T), meaning 1 000 000 000 000\nSo, 1 kilobyte is 1 000 bytes, 1 megabyte is 1 000 000 bytes, 1 gigabyte is 1 000 000 000 bytes, and 1 terabyte is 10\n12\nbytes.\nWhen storing data, we use these units to measure the size of the data.\nFor example, storing the 500x300 pixel tiger image below, with 3 bytes per pixel to store the color (24 bit color depth), requires 500 * 300 * 3 = 450 000 bytes.\nThe image above is 450 000 bytes, or 450 kB (kilobytes).\nBut in computing, using\nbinary numbers\ninstead of the decimal system, measuring data storage units can be a bit confusing, because 1 kilobyte some times refers to 2\n10\n= 1024 bytes instead of 1 000 bytes, and 1 megabyte is some times 2\n20\n= 1024 * 1024 bytes instead of 1 000 000 bytes, and so on.\nUsing this kind of measuring, the image above is 450 000 / 1024 = 441 kB, so almost the same as before, but not quite.\nTo avoid this confusion, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has defined the following units:\nkibi- (Ki), meaning 1024\nmebi- (Mi), meaning 1024 * 1024\ngibi- (Gi), meaning 1024 * 1024 * 1024\nSo, to be absolutely clear and correct, we should say that the image above is either 450 kB, or 441 KiB.\nData Transfer Units\nMeasuring data transfer speeds is just like measuring data storage units, but with the \"per second\" at the end.\nThe unit for data transfer speeds in bits is \"bits per second\" (bps or b/s), and the unit for data transfer speeds in bytes is \"bytes per second\" (Bps or B/s).\nWhen larger amounts of data are transferred, we use prefixes:\nkilobits per second (kbps)\nmegabits per second (Mbps)\ngigabits per second (Gbps)\nWith kilo-, mega- and giga- referring to 1000, 1 000 000 and 1 000 000 000, respectively.\nAnd the same prefixes are used for transfer speeds in bytes.\nJust like with data storage units, the prefixes kibi-, mebi- and gibi- should be used to refer to 1024, 1024 * 1024 and 1024 * 1024 * 1024, respectively.\nData transfer speeds can be confusing.\n500 Mbps looks much faster than 62.5 MBps, doesn't it?\nBut 500 Mbps is in fact the same as 62.5 MBps (500 / 8 = 62.5). Lower case \"b\" means \"bits\", and upper case \"B\" means \"bytes\".\n\n\u2605\n+1",
