      "content": "Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on values or variables, one bit at a time.\nWhat is a Bitwise Operator?\nA bitwise operator is a symbol or keyword that tells the computer what operation to perform, bit by bit, on values or variables.\nSee\nthis page\nfor an overview of other types of operators.\nThe most common bitwise operators are:\n&\n(Bitwise AND)\n|\n(Bitwise OR)\n^\n(Bitwise XOR)\n~\n(Bitwise NOT)\n<<\n(Left shift)\n>>\n(Right shift)\nAll data in the computer is stored as sequences of\n0\ns and\n1\ns. This makes it possible to use bitwise operators to manipulate the data.\nUse the simulation below to click around and see the result of different bitwise operators:\n{{ operatorText }}\n{{ op.codeSnippet }}\na\n{{ bit }}\n{{ resultingDecimalA }}\noperator\n{{ selectedOperator }}\nb\n{{ bit }}\n{{ resultingDecimalB }}\nresult\n{{ bit }}\n{{ resultingDecimalResult }}\nRun\nIn the simulation above, the rightmost column shows the decimal values of the variables\na\n,\nb\n, and\nresult\n. The decimal numbers are displayed to give a better understanding of what happens if you do the operation\n11 & 7\n(using decimal numbers), and why the result is\n3\n.\nLeft shift\n<<\n, and right shift\n>>\noperators shift the bits of variable\na\nto the left or right. The number of positions to shift is specified by second variable\nb\n, that is why variable\nb\nis limited to the first 2 bits in the simulation above.\nIn the example below, we use the bitwise OR operator\n|\nto combine two variables stored in binary format:\na = 0b1010\nb = 0b0110\nresult = a | b\nprint(bin(result))\nconst a = 0b1010;\nconst b = 0b0110;\nconst result = a | b;\nconsole.log(result.toString(2));\nint a = 0b1010;\nint b = 0b0110;\nint result = a | b;\nSystem.out.println(Integer.toBinaryString(result));\nint a = 0b1010;\nint b = 0b0110;\nint result = a | b;\ncout << bitset<4>(result);\nRun Example \u00bb\n\n\u2605\n+1",
