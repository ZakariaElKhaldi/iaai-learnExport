      "content": "=\nStores the value\ninto the variable\nThe code above creates a variable named\nfavFruit\n, and the equal sign\n=\nis used to store the value\n'apple'\ninside the variable.\nThe reason for giving a variable a name is to be able to use it later in the code, and also to know what value it holds.\nCreating a Variable\nBelow is the code for creating the\nfavAnimal\nvariable in different programming languages.\nfavAnimal = 'turtles'\nconst favAnimal = 'turtles';\nString favAnimal = \"turtles\";\nstring fav_animal = \"turtles\";\nRun Example \u00bb\nVariables can hold different types of data, like whole numbers, decimal numbers, or text.\nNote:\nWhen creating a variable in programming languages like C/C++ and Java, we must tell the computer what type of data the variable holds. To do that we need to write for example\nint\nin front of the variable name, if the variable holds a whole number (integer).\nDoing Things with Variables\nLike we have just seen in the \nWe can do other things with variables as well, like math operations, or put variables with text strings together.\nAdd a Variable to a String\nTo use a variable in a string, you can add it to the string, like this:\na = 'Jane'\nprint('Hello, my name is ' + a)\nconst a = 'Jane';\nconsole.log('Hello, my name is ' + a);\nString a = \"Jane\";\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello, my name is \" + a);\nstring a = \"Jane\";\ncout << \"Hello, my name is \" + a;\nRun Example \u00bb\nAdd Two String Variables Together\nYou can add two string variables together to form a sentence, using the\n+\noperator, like this:\na = 'Jane'\nb = 'My name is '\nprint(b + a)\nconst a = 'Jane';\nconst b = 'My name is ';\nconsole.log(b + a);\nString a = \"Jane\";\nString b = \"My name is \";\nSystem.out.println(b + a);\nstring a = \"Jane\";\nstring b = \"My name is \";\ncout << b + a;\nRun Example \u00bb\nAdd Two Number Variables\nIf the variables are numeric values, you can perform mathematic operations on them, like adding two numbers:\na = 2\nb = 3\nprint(a + b)\nconst a = 2;\nconst b = 3;\nconsole.log(a + b);\nint a = 2;\nint b = 3;\nSystem.out.println(a + b);\nint a = 2;\nint b = 3;\ncout << a + b;\nRun Example \u00bb\nor other mathematical operations, like division:\na = 12\nb = 3\nprint(a / b)\nconst a = 12;\nconst b = 3;\nconsole.log(a / b);\nint a = 12;\nint b = 3;\nSystem.out.println(a / b);\nint a = 12;\nint b = 3;\ncout << a / b;\nRun Example \u00bb\nAnother way to add two variables, is to make an extra variable\nc\nto hold the sum, and present the answer with a text string:\na = 2\nb = 3\nc = a + b\nprint('The sum a + b is ' + str(c))\nconst a = 2;\nconst b = 3;\nconst c = a + b;\nconsole.log('The sum a + b is ' + c);\nint a = 2;\nint b = 3;\nint c = a + b;\nSystem.out.println(\"The sum a + b is \" + c);\nint a = 2;\nint b = 3;\nint c = a + b;\ncout << \"The sum a + b is \" + to_string(c) + \"\\\\n\";\nRun Example \u00bb\nNote:\nThe\n+\noperator is used to both add numbers, and to put strings together. In Python and C++ we need to convert a number to a string before we can put it together with a string.\nIncrementing a Variable\nWe can create a variable, and update the value by adding 1 to it, like this:\na = 2\na = a + 1\nprint(a)\nlet a = 2;\na = a + 1;\nconsole.log(a);\nint a = 2;\na = a + 1;\nSystem.out.println(a);\nint a = 2;\na = a + 1;\ncout << a;\nRun Example \u00bb\nIncrementing a variable is a common operation in programming, and it's often used in loops. It is so common in fact, that many programming languages have a shorthand for it, like\n++\nin C/C++ and Java, or\n+=\nin Python.\nThe code below shows how to increment a variable in different programming languages, using shorthand.\na = 2\na += 1\nprint(a)\nlet a = 2;\na += 1;\nconsole.log(a);\nint a = 2;\na += 1;\nSystem.out.println(a);\nint a = 2;\na += 1;\ncout << a;\nRun Example \u00bb\nDecrementing a Variable\nIf we want to decrement a variable, we can do that in a similar way as incrementing. And the number we want to decrement by can be any number, not just 1.\nThe code below shows how to decrement a variable by 3 in different programming languages, using shorthand.\na = 5\na -= 3\nprint(a)\nlet a = 5;\na -= 3;\nconsole.log(a);\nint a = 5;\na -= 3;\nSystem.out.println(a);\nint a = 5;\na -= 3;\ncout << a;\nRun Example \u00bb\nUsing a Variable in an if Statement\nWe can use a variable in an\nif statement\n, as part of the condition, like this:\ntemperature = 25\nprint('Temperature: ' + str(temperature) + '\u00b0C')\n\nif temperature > 20:\n  print('It is warm')\nelse:\n  print('It is not warm')\nconst temperature = 25;\nconsole.log('Temperature: ' + temperature + '\u00b0C');\n\nif (temperature > 20) {\n  console.log('It is warm');\n} else {\n  console.log('It is not warm');\n}\nint temperature = 25;\nSystem.out.println(\"Temperature: \" + temperature + \"\u00b0C\");\n\nif (temperature > 20) {\n  System.out.println(\"It is warm\");\n} else {\n  System.out.println(\"It is not warm\");\n}\nint temperature = 25;\ncout << \"Temperature: \" + to_string(temperature) + \"\u00b0C\\\\n\";\n\nif (temperature > 20) {\n  cout << \"It is warm\\\\n\";\n} else {\n  cout << \"It is not warm\\\\n\";\n}\nRun Example \u00bb\nThe Variable Name\nThere are certain rules that applies when naming a variable. Some rules are programming-languange-specific, other applies to all programming languages:\nA variable name cannot contain spaces.\nA variable name cannot start with a number.\nA variable name cannot be a reserved word like if, else, for, function etc.\nFor readability, it is common to use\ncamelCase\nor\nsnake_case\nwhen naming variables, so instead of\nmyfavanimal\n, we can use\nmyFavAnimal\nor\nmy_fav_animal\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
