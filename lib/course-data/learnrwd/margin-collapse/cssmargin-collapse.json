Only top and bottom margins!\nLook at the following example:\nExample\nDemonstration of margin collapse:\nh1 {\nmargin: 0 0 50px 0;\n}\nh2 {\nmargin: 20px 0 0 0;\n}\n\nIn the example above, the <h1> element has a bottom margin of 50px and \nthe <h2> \nelement has a top margin set to 20px.\nCommon sense would seem to suggest that the vertical margin between the <h1> \nand the <h2> would be a total of 70px (50px + 20px). But due to margin collapse, \nthe actual margin ends up being 50px.\nAll CSS Margin Properties\nProperty\nDescription\nmargin\nA shorthand property for setting all the margin properties in one declaration\nmargin-bottom\nSets the bottom margin of an element\nmargin-left\nSets the left margin of an element\nmargin-right\nSets the right margin of an element\nmargin-top\nSets the top margin of an element\n\n\u2605\n+1",
