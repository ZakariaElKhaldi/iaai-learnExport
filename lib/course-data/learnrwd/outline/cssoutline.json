Unlike border, the outline is \ndrawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is \nNOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height\nis not affected by the width of the outline.\nCSS Outline Style\nThe\noutline-style\nproperty specifies the style of the outline, \nand can have one of the following values:\ndotted\n- Defines a dotted outline\ndashed\n- Defines a dashed outline\nsolid\n- Defines a solid outline\ndouble\n- Defines a double outline\ngroove\n- Defines a 3D grooved outline\nridge\n- Defines a 3D ridged outline\ninset\n- Defines a 3D inset outline\noutset\n- Defines a 3D outset outline\nnone\n- Defines no outline\nhidden\n- Defines a hidden outline\nThe following example shows the different\noutline-style\nvalues:\nExample\nDemonstration of the different outline styles:\np.dotted {outline-style: dotted;}\np.dashed {outline-style: dashed;}\np.solid {outline-style: solid;}\np.double {outline-style: double;}\np.groove {outline-style: groove;}\np.ridge {outline-style: ridge;}\np.inset {outline-style: inset;}\np.outset {outline-style: outset;}\nResult:\nA dotted outline.\nA dashed outline.\nA solid outline.\nA double outline.\nA groove outline. The effect depends on the outline-color value.\nA ridge outline. The effect depends on the outline-color value.\nAn inset outline. The effect depends on the outline-color value.\nAn outset outline.
