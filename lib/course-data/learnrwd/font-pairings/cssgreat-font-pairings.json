      "content": "Great font pairings are essential to great design.\nFont Pairing Rules\nHere are some basic rules to create great font pairings:\n1. Complement\nIt is always safe to find font pairings that complement one another.\nA great font combination should harmonize, without being too similar or too different.\n2. Use Font Superfamilies\nA font superfamily is a set of fonts designed to work well together. So, using different fonts within the same superfamily is safe.\nFor example, the Lucida superfamily contains the following fonts: Lucida \nSans, Lucida Serif, Lucida Typewriter Sans, Lucida Typewriter Serif and Lucida Math.\n3. Contrast is King\nTwo fonts that are too similar will often conflict. However, contrasts, done \nthe right way, brings out the best in each font.\nExample: Combining serif with sans serif is a well known combination.\nA strong superfamily includes both serif and sans serif variations of the same font (e.g. Lucida and Lucida Sans).\n4. Choose Only One Boss\nOne font should be the boss. This establishes a hierarchy for the fonts on \nyour page. This can be achieved by varying the size, weight and color.\nExample\nNo doubt \"Georgia\" is the boss here:\nbody {\nbackground-color: black;\nfont-family: Verdana, \n  sans-serif;\nfont-size: 16px;\ncolor: gray;\n}\nh1 \n  {\nfont-family: Georgia, serif;\nfont-size: 60px;\ncolor: white;\n}\n\nBelow, we have shown some popular font pairings that will suit many brands and contexts.\nGeorgia and Verdana\nGeorgia and Verdana is a classic combination. It also sticks to the web safe font standards:\nExample\nUse the \"Georgia\" font for headings, and \"Verdana\" for text:\nBeautiful Norway\nNorway has a total area of 385,252 square \nkilometers and a population of 5,438,657 (December 2020). Norway is bordered by Sweden, Finland and Russia to the north-east, and the Skagerrak to the south, with Denmark on the other side.\nNorway has beautiful mountains, glaciers and stunning fjords. Oslo, the capital, is a city of green spaces and museums. Bergen, with colorful wooden houses, is the starting point for cruises to the dramatic Sognefjord. Norway is also known for fishing, hiking and skiing.\n\nHelvetica and Garamond\nHelvetica and Garamond is another classic combination that uses web safe fonts:\nExample\nUse the \"Helvetica\" font for headings, and \"Garamond\" for text:\nBeautiful Norway\nNorway has a total area of 385,252 square \nkilometers and a population of 5,438,657 (December 2020). Norway is bordered by Sweden, Finland and Russia to the north-east, and the Skagerrak to the south, with Denmark on the other side.\nNorway has beautiful mountains, glaciers and stunning fjords. Oslo, the capital, is a city of green spaces and museums. Bergen, with colorful wooden houses, is the starting point for cruises to the dramatic Sognefjord. Norway is also known for fishing, hiking and skiing.\n\nPopular Google Font Pairings\nIf you do not want to use standard fonts in HTML, you can use Google Fonts.\nGoogle Fonts are free to use, and have more than 1000 fonts to choose from.\nBelow are some popular Google Web Font Pairings.\nMerriweather and Open Sans\nExample\nUse the \"Merriweather\" font for headings, and \"Open Sans\" for text:\nBeautiful Norway\nNorway has a total area of 385,252 square \nkilometers and a population of 5,438,657 (December 2020).
