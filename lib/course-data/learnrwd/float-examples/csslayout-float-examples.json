      "content": "This page contains common float examples.\nGrid of Boxes / Equal Width Boxes\nBox 1\nBox 2\nBox 1\nBox 2\nBox 3\nWith the\nfloat\nproperty, it is easy to float boxes of content side by side:\nExample\n* {\nbox-sizing: border-box;\n}\n.box {\nfloat: left;\nwidth: 33.33%; /* three \n  boxes (use 25% for four, and 50% for two, etc) */\npadding: \n  50px; /* if you want space between the images */\n}\n\nWhat is box-sizing?\nYou can easily create three floating boxes side by side. However, when you add something that enlarges the width of each box (e.g. padding or borders), the box will break. The\nbox-sizing\nproperty allows us to include the padding and border in the box's total width (and height), making sure that the padding stays inside of the box and that it does not break.\nYou can read more about the box-sizing property in our\nCSS Box Sizing Chapter\n.\nImages Side By Side\nThe grid of boxes can also be used to display images side by side:\nExample\n.img-container {\nfloat: left;\nwidth: 33.33%; /* three \n  containers (use 25% for four, and 50% for two, etc) */\npadding: \n  5px; /* if you want space between the images */\n}\n\nEqual Height Boxes\nIn the \nhowever, is to set a fixed height, like in the example below:\nBox 1\nSome content, some content, some content\nBox 2\nSome content, some content, some content\nSome content, some content, some content\nSome content, some content, some content\nExample\n.box {\nheight: 500px;\n}\n\nHowever\n, this is not very flexible. It is ok if you can guarantee that the boxes will always have the same amount of content in them. \nBut many times, the content is not the same. If you try the example above on a mobile phone, you will see that the second \nbox's content will be displayed outside of the box. \nThis is where CSS3 Flexbox comes in handy - as it can automatically stretch \nboxes to be as long as the longest box:\nExample\nUsing\nFlexbox\nto create flexible boxes:\nBox 1 - This is some text to make sure that the content gets really tall. This is some text to make sure that the content gets really tall. This is some text to make sure that the content gets really tall.\nBox 2 - My height will follow Box 1.\n\nTip:\nYou can read more about the Flexbox Layout Module in our\nCSS Flexbox Chapter\n.\nNavigation Menu\nYou can also use\nfloat\nwith a list of hyperlinks to create a horizontal menu:\nExample\nHome\nNews\nContact\nAbout\n\nWeb Layout Example\nIt is also common to do entire web layouts using the\nfloat\nproperty:\nExample\n.header, .footer {\nbackground-color: grey;\ncolor: white;\npadding: 15px;\n}\n.column {\nfloat: left;\npadding: 15px;\n}\n.clearfix::after {\ncontent: \n  \"\";\nclear: both;\ndisplay: table;\n}\n.menu {\nwidth: 25%;\n}\n.content {\nwidth: 75%;\n}\n\nMore Examples\nAn image with border and margins that floats to the right in a paragraph\nLet an image float to the right in a paragraph. Add border and margins to the image.\nAn image with a caption that floats to the right\nLet an image with a caption float to the right.\nLet the first letter of a paragraph float to the left\nLet the first letter of a paragraph float to the left and style the letter.\nCreating a website with float\nUse float to create a homepage with a navbar, header, footer, left content and main content.\nAll CSS Float Properties\nProperty\nDescription\nbox-sizing\nDefines how the width and height of an element are calculated: should they include padding and borders, or not\nclear\nSpecifies what should happen with the element that is \n    element\nfloat\nSpecifies whether an element should float to the left, right, or not at \n    all\noverflow\nSpecifies what happens if content overflows an element's box\noverflow-x\nSpecifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content if it overflows the element's content area\noverflow-y\nSpecifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content if it overflows the element's content area\n\n\u2605\n+1",
