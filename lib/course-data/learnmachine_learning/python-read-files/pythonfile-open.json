Welcome to demofile.txt\nThis file is for testing purposes.\nGood \n  Luck!\nTo open the file, use the built-in\nopen()\nfunction.\nThe\nopen()\nfunction returns a file object, which has a\nread()\nmethod for reading the content of the file:\nExample\nf = open(\"demofile.txt\")\nprint(f.read())\nRun Example \u00bb\nIf the file is located in a different location, you will have to specify the file path, \nlike this:\nExample\nOpen a file on a different location:\nf = open(\"D:\\\\myfiles\\welcome.txt\")\nprint(f.read())\nRun Example \u00bb\nUsing the\nwith\nstatement\nYou can also use the\nwith\nstatement when opening a file:\nExample\nUsing the\nwith\nkeyword:\nwith open(\"demofile.txt\") as f:\nprint(f.read())\nRun Example \u00bb\nThen you do not have to worry about closing your files, the\nwith\nstatement takes care of that.\nClose Files\nIt is a good practice to always close the file when you are done with it.\nIf you are not using the\nwith\nstatement, you must write a close statement in order to close the file:\nExample\nClose the file when you are finished with it:\nf = open(\"demofile.txt\")\nprint(f.readline())\nf.close()\nRun Example \u00bb\nNote:\nYou should always close your files. In some cases, due to buffering, changes made to a file may not show until you close the file.\nRead Only Parts of the File\nBy default the\nread()\nmethod returns the whole text, but you can also specify how many characters you want to return:\nExample\nReturn the 5 first characters of the file:\nwith open(\"demofile.txt\") as f:\nprint(f.read(\n5\n))\nRun Example \u00bb\nRead Lines\nYou can return one line by using the\nreadline()\nmethod:\nExample\nRead one line of the file:\nwith open(\"demofile.txt\") as f:\nprint(f.readline())\nRun Example \u00bb\nBy calling\nreadline()\ntwo times, you can read the \ntwo first lines:\nExample\nRead two lines of the file:\nwith open(\"demofile.txt\") as f:\nprint(f.readline())\nprint(f.readline())\nRun Example \u00bb\nBy looping through the lines of the file, you can read the whole file, line by line:\nExample\nLoop through the file line by line:\nwith open(\"demofile.txt\") as f:\nfor x in f:\nprint(x)\nRun Example \u00bb\n\n\u2605\n+1",
