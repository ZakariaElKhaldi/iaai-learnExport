      "content": ".\nMachine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI).\nMachine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the \noutcome.\nWhere To Start?\nIn this tutorial we will go back to mathematics and study statistics, and how to calculate \nimportant numbers based on data sets.\nWe will also learn how to use various Python modules to get the answers we \nneed.\nAnd we will learn how to make functions that are able to predict the outcome \nbased on what we have learned.\nData Set\nIn the mind of a computer, a data set is any collection of data.\nIt can be anything from an array to a complete database.\nExample of an array:\n[99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]\nExample of a database:\nCarname\nColor\nAge\nSpeed\nAutoPass\nBMW\nred\n5\n99\nY\nVolvo\nblack\n7\n86\nY\nVW\ngray\n8\n87\nN\nVW\nwhite\n7\n88\nY\nFord\nwhite\n2\n111\nY\nVW\nwhite\n17\n86\nY\nTesla\nred\n2\n103\nY\nBMW\nblack\n9\n87\nY\nVolvo\ngray\n4\n94\nN\nFord\nwhite\n11\n78\nN\nToyota\ngray\n12\n77\nN\nVW\nwhite\n9\n85\nN\nToyota\nblue\n6\n86\nY\nBy looking at the array, we can guess that the average value is probably around 80 \nor 90, and we are also able to determine the highest value and the lowest value, but what else can we do?\nAnd by looking at the database we can see that the most popular color is white, and the oldest car is 17 years,\nbut what if we could predict if a car had an AutoPass, just by looking at the other values?\nThat is what Machine Learning is for! Analyzing data and predicting the outcome!\nIn Machine Learning it is common to work with very large data sets. In this \n  tutorial we will try to make it as easy as possible to understand the \n  different concepts of machine learning, and we will work with small \n  easy-to-understand data sets.\nData Types\nTo analyze data, it is important to know what type of data we are dealing with.\nWe can split the data types into three main categories:\nNumerical\nCategorical\nOrdinal\nNumerical\ndata are numbers, and can be split into two \nnumerical categories:",

Example: school grades where A is better than B and so \non.\nBy knowing the data type of your data source, you will be able to know what \ntechnique to use when analyzing them.\nYou will learn more about statistics and analyzing data in the \n\n\u2605\n+1",
