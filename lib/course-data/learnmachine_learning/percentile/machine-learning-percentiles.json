The answer is 43, meaning that 75% of the people \nare 43 or younger.\nThe NumPy module has a method for finding the specified percentile:\nExample\nUse the NumPy\npercentile()\nmethod to find \nthe percentiles:\nimport numpy\nages = \n  [5,31,43,48,50,41,7,11,15,39,80,82,32,2,8,6,25,36,27,61,31]\nx = numpy.percentile(ages, 75)\nprint(x)\n\nExample\nWhat is the age that 90% of the people are younger than?\nimport numpy\nages = \n  [5,31,43,48,50,41,7,11,15,39,80,82,32,2,8,6,25,36,27,61,31]\nx = numpy.percentile(ages, 90)\nprint(x)\n\n\u2605\n+1",
