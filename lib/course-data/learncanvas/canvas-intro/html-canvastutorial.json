You must use a script to actually draw the graphics.\nCanvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.\nCanvas is supported by all major browsers.\nHTML Canvas Example\nYour browser does not support the <canvas> element.\nThe graphic above is created with\n<canvas>\n. It contains four \nobjects: a red rectangle, a gradient rectangle, a multicolor rectangle, and a multicolor text.\nWhat you should already know\nBefore you continue, you should have a basic understanding of the following:\nHTML\nBasic JavaScript\nIf you want to study these subjects first, find the tutorials on our\nHome page\n.\nWhat is HTML Canvas?\nThe HTML\n<canvas>\nelement is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript).\nThe\n<canvas>\nelement is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics.\nCanvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.\nHTML Canvas Can Draw Text\nCanvas can draw colorful text, with or without animation.\nHTML Canvas Can Draw Graphics\nCanvas has great features for graphical data presentation with an imagery of \ngraphs and charts.\nHTML Canvas Can be Animated\nCanvas objects can move. Everything is possible: from simple bouncing balls \nto complex animations.\nHTML Canvas Can be Interactive\nCanvas can respond to \nJavaScript events.\nCanvas can respond to any user action (key clicks, mouse \nclicks, button clicks, finger movement).\nHTML Canvas Can be Used in Games\nCanvas' methods for animations, offer a lot of possibilities for HTML gaming \napplications.\nCanvas Example\nIn HTML, a\n<canvas>\nelement looks like this:\n<canvas id=\"myCanvas\" width=\"200\" height=\"100\"></canvas>\nThe\nid\nattribute is required (so it can be referred to by JavaScript).\nThe\nwidth\nand\nheight\nattribute defines the size of the canvas.\nTip:\nThe default size of the canvas is 300px (width) x 150px (height).\nTip:\nYou can have multiple\n<canvas>\nelements on one HTML page.\nBy default, the\n<canvas>\nelement has no \nborder and no content.\nTo add a border, use a\nstyle\nattribute:\nExample\n<canvas id=\"myCanvas\" width=\"200\" height=\"100\"\nstyle=\"border:1px solid \n#000000;\"></canvas>\n\nThe \nSee Also:\n' Full Canvas Reference\n\n\u2605\n+1",
