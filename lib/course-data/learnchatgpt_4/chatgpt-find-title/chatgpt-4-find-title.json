The more specific you get, the better suggestions you will get.\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nSuggest 10 titles for a short story about a robot posing as a student. It is written from a teenager's perspective, and the robot is almost a perfect copy of a human. They find friends and fall in love. But they still can't solve captchas when browsing the internet.\nA response from ChatGPT-4 could be:\nWe have a list with very different titles to refine and work on.\nRefine and Experiment\nI like number 5. Let's give ChatGPT a bit more information and work from that:\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nNumber 5 suits the story well, as the story is mainly about the robot figuring out how to stay true to its robotic nature but at the same time develop as a human. Based on that, suggest 10 more titles.\nA response from ChatGPT-4 could be:\nNow you can continue to work with these titles, further refining or taking parts of what you have to make your own.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
