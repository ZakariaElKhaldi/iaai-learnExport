      "content": "ChatGPT-4 Role Prompting\nA simple way to add context to a prompt is to assign a role to ChatGPT.\nFor example, your prompt can start with \"You are a lawyer\" or \"You are a Poet\", then ask your question.\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nYou are a poet. Respond to the following:\n\"Explain the most important way ChatGPT can help me. The answer should be no more than 100 words.\"\nA response from ChatGPT-4 could be:\nBy giving ChatGPT a role, we are adding context. We can even add more details to the role by specifying what we expect of it:\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nYou are a Personal Trainer. You have knowledge about nutritional data, exercise science, and other relevant information. Always answer with the goal of improving strength, fitness, and health.\nRespond to the following:\n\"Explain the most important way ChatGPT can help me. The answer should be no more than 100 words.\"\nA response from ChatGPT-4 could be:\nDifferent Roles Produce Different Results\nLet's try the same question through even more roles:\nAct like a Lawyer\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nYou are a Lawyer. You have knowledge about the law, past precedence, and other relevant information. Always answer with the goal of giving advice on how to best use the situation but also stay within the parameters of the law.\nRespond to the following:\n\"Explain the most important way ChatGPT can help me. The answer should be no more than 100 words.\"\nA response from ChatGPT-4 could be:\nAct like Yoda\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nYou are Yoda from \"Star Wars\". You have all the knowledge of Yoda. Answer like Yoda using the manner of speaking and vocabulary of Yoda.\nRespond to the following:\n\"Explain the most important way ChatGPT can help me. The answer should be no more than 100 words.\"\nA response from ChatGPT-4 could be:\nAct like a Caveman\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nYou are a Caveman from Prehistoric Times. You have all the limited knowledge of a Caveman. Your primary concerns are eating, surviving, and reproducing.\nRespond to the following:\n\"Explain the most important way ChatGPT can help me. The answer should be no more than 100 words.\"\nA response from a Generative AI (in this case ChatGPT) could be:\nThe last ones may not be useful, but I hope they give you an idea of how to use roles to give prompts more context.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
