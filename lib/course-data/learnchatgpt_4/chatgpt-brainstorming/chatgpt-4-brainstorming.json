Finding a name for a cat? In this example, we will brainstorm ideas for activities for a birthday party for five-year-old girls.\nAsk Open-Ended Questions\nUnlike when you ask ChatGPT for something specific, it is important to keep it open-ended for brainstorming sessions. This will give you a wider range of responses:\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nWhat are some unique ideas for activities for 10 five-year-old girls at a birthday party?\nA response from ChatGPT-4 could be:\nThat is a good list of starting points. Let's narrow it down, then expand it further.\nFollow-Ups with more Details\nFrom the list above, let's move forward with ideas 1 and 5. Combine them into one for a nature princess party!\nTo get more details, we can ask ChatGPT to add unique details:\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nCombine ideas 1 and 5. Make this into a unique experience that the children will remember. Write a story the girls can act out, and make sure it gives everyone something to do.\nA response from ChatGPT-4 could be:\nNow that sounds like a good time!\nRefine Further\nNow we have our key idea, let's refine it further.\nExample\nWith the following prompt:\nFor activity 9, give me 2 examples of epic narration from each activity. Something we can use as a template and build from depending on how it went.\nA response from ChatGPT-4 could be:\nThat was an example of how you can start with a basic idea and, with the help of ChatGPT, transform it into something unique.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
