But \nwe know it is available on \n{{title}}. So we can use the\n-a\noption to see all local and remote branches:\nExample\ngit branch -a\n* master\n  remotes/origin/html-skeleton\n  remotes/origin/master\nNote:\nbranch -r\nis for remote branches only.\nWe see that the branch\nhtml-skeleton\nis available remotely, but not on our local git. Lets check it out:\nExample\ngit checkout html-skeleton\nSwitched to a new branch 'html-skeleton'\nBranch 'html-skeleton' set up to track remote branch 'html-skeleton' from 'origin'.\nAnd check if it is all up to date:\nExample\ngit pull\nAlready up to date.\nWhich branches do we have now, and where are we working from?\nExample\ngit branch\n* html-skeleton\n  master\nNow, open your favourite editor and confirm that the changes from the {{title}} branch carried over.\nThat is how you pull a {{title}} branch to your local Git.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
