These are called\nremote repositories\n.\nIn this tutorial, you'll learn how to use Git for your own projects and how to connect with remote repositories online.\nLearning by Examples\nIn this tutorial, we will show you Git commands like this:\nExample\ngit --version\ngit version 2.30.2.windows.1\nFor new users, using the terminal view can seem a bit complicated.\nDon't worry! We will keep it really simple, and learning this way gives you a good grasp of how Git works.\nIn the code above, you can see commands (input) and output.\nLines like this are commands we input:\nExample\ngit --version\nLines like this are the output/response to our commands:\nExample\ngit version 2.30.2.windows.1\nIn general, lines with\n$\nin front of it is input.\nThese are the commands you can copy and run in your terminal.\nTip for Beginners:\nDon't worry about making mistakes!\nWhen you use Git on your own computer, you can't really break anything important.\nExperimenting is a great way to learn, and you can always undo or redo changes as you go.\nChange Platform:\nGitHub\nBitbucket\nGitLab\nWhat Changes When You Switch Platform?\nThe tutorial can show examples for GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.\nThe Git commands are mostly the same, but some steps (like connecting to a remote or pushing code) might look a little different depending on the platform you choose.\nUse the menu to see examples for each platform.\nWhy Practice with Exercises?\nPracticing with exercises helps you remember the commands and understand how Git works.\nTry the exercises and quiz to test your knowledge!\nGit Quiz\nTest your Git skills with a quiz.\nStart Git Quiz\n\nCreate a free  account and get access to more features and learning materials:\nView your completed tutorials, exercises, and quizzes\nKeep an eye on your progress and daily streaks\nSet goals and create learning paths\nCreate your own personal website\n\nNote:\nThis is an optional feature.
