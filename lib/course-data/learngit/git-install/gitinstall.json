      "content": "How to Install Git\nYou can download Git for free from\ngit-scm.com\n.\nWindows:\nDownload and run the installer.\nClick \u201c\nThis will install Git and Git Bash.\nmacOS:\nIf you use Homebrew, open Terminal and type\nbrew install git\n.\nOr, download the .dmg file and drag Git to your Applications folder.\nLinux:\nOpen your terminal and use your package manager.\nFor example, on Ubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install git\nAfter installation, you will be able to use Git from your terminal or command prompt.\nTip for Beginners:\nInstalling Git is safe and you can always uninstall it later if you want.\nGit Bash\nGit Bash is a terminal for Windows that lets you use Git commands.\nLook at our\nBash Tutorial\nto learn more about Bash.\nAfter installing Git, you can find Git Bash in your Start menu.\nYou can use Git Bash just like the Command Prompt, but with extra Unix commands (like\nls\nand\npwd\n).\nExample: Open Git Bash\nClick Start, type \"Git Bash\", and open the app.\nExample: First Command in Git Bash\nls\nDesktop  Documents  Downloads  Pictures\nThis command lists the files in your current folder.\nVerifying Your Installation\nAfter installing, check that Git works by opening your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and running:\nExample: Check Git Version\ngit --version\ngit version 2.43.0.windows.1\nIf Git is installed, you will see something like\ngit version X.Y.Z\nIf you see an error, try closing and reopening your terminal, or check that Git is in your PATH.\nDefault Editor\nDuring installation, Git asks you to pick a default text editor.\nThis is the program that will open when you need to write messages (like for commits).\nExample: Set VS Code as Default Editor\ngit config --global core.editor \"code --wait\"\nIf you're not sure, just pick the default (Notepad on Windows). You can always change this later.\nExample: Set Notepad as Default Editor\ngit config --global core.editor \"notepad\"\nPATH Environment\nChoosing to add Git to your PATH means you can use Git commands in any terminal window.\nThis is highly recommended for most users to do this during installation.\nIf you skip this, you'll only be able to use Git in Git Bash (on Windows) or Terminal (on macOS and Linux).\nExample: Check if Git is in PATH\ngit --version\ngit version 2.43.0.windows.1\nIf you see an error, you need to add Git to your PATH.\nHow to Add Git to PATH after Installation\nWindows:\nIf you missed the option during installation, search for \"Environment Variables\" in the Start menu and open it.\nClick \"Environment Variables...\" and find the \"Path\" variable under \"System variables\".\nClick \"Edit\", then \"New\", and add the path to your Git\nbin\nand\ncmd\nfolders\n(e.g.,\nC:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\nand\nC:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd\n).\nClick OK to save. Restart your terminal.\nmacOS:\nIf you installed with Homebrew, your PATH is usually set automatically.\nIf not, open Terminal and add this line to your\n~/.zshrc\nor\n~/.bash_profile\n:\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\nSave the file and run\nsource ~/.zshrc\nor\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n.\nLinux:\nMost package managers add Git to PATH automatically.\nIf not, add this line to your\n~/.bashrc\nor\n~/.profile\n:\nexport PATH=\"/usr/bin:$PATH\"\nSave the file and run\nsource ~/.bashrc\nor\nsource ~/.profile\n.\nAfter adding Git to your PATH, open a new terminal window and run\ngit --version\nto check that it works everywhere.\nLine Endings\nGit can convert line endings in text files.\nOn Windows, it's usually best to select \"Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings\".\nThis helps prevent problems when you share code with people using different operating systems.\nUpdating or Uninstalling Git\nUpdate:\nDownload and run the latest installer, or use your package manager\n(e.g.,\nbrew upgrade git\nor\nsudo apt-get upgrade git\n).\nIt's a good idea to keep Git up to date for the latest features and security fixes.\nUninstall:\nUse \"Add or Remove Programs\" on Windows, or your package manager on Mac/Linux.\nTroubleshooting Git Installation\nIf you run into problems installing or running Git, don't worry!\nHere are solutions to some of the most common issues.\nTip:\nIf something doesn't work right away, try closing and reopening your terminal, or restarting your computer.\nCommon Installation Issues\n\"git is not recognized as an internal or external command\"\nSolution:\nGit is not in your system's PATH. Make sure you installed Git and restart your terminal.\nIf needed, add Git's\nbin\nfolder (usually\nC:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\n) to your PATH.\nIf it still doesn't work, try restarting your computer.\nPermission errors (\"Permission denied\")\nSolution:\nOn Windows, run Git Bash or your terminal as administrator.\nOn macOS/Linux, use\nsudo\nif necessary.\nSSL or HTTPS errors when cloning/pushing\nSolution:\nCheck your internet connection.\nMake sure your Git version is up to date.\nWrong version of Git\nSolution:\nCheck your installed version with\ngit --version\n.\nDownload the latest version from\ngit-scm.com\nif needed.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
