And it works around the rule that the master branch is ALWAYS deployable.\nThat means, if you want to try something new or experiment, you create a new branch!\nBranching gives you an environment where you can make changes without affecting the main branch.\nWhen your new branch is ready, it can be reviewed, discussed, and merged with the main branch when ready.\nWhen you make a new branch, you will (almost always) want to make it from the master branch.\nNote:\nKeep in mind that you are working with others.\nUsing descriptive names for new branches, so everyone can understand what is happening.\nMake Changes and Add Commits\nAfter the new branch is created, it is time to get to work.\nMake changes by adding, editing and deleting files.\nWhenever you reach a small milestone, add the changes to your branch by commit.\nAdding commits keeps track of your work.\nEach commit should have a message explaining what has changed and why.\nEach commit becomes a part of the history of the branch, and a point you can revert back to if you need to.\nNote:\ncommit messages are very important! Let everyone know what has changed and why.\nMessages and comments make it so much easier for yourself and other people to keep track of changes.\nOpen a Pull Request\nPull requests are a key part of GitHub.\nA Pull Request notifies people you have changes ready for them to consider or review.\nYou can ask others to review your changes or pull your contribution and merge it into their branch.\nReview\nWhen a Pull Request is made, it can be reviewed by whoever has the proper access to the branch.\nThis is where good discussions and review of the changes happen.\nPull Requests are designed to allow people to work together easily and produce better results together!\nIf you receive feedback and continue to improve your changes, you can push your changes with new commits, making further reviews possible.\nNote:\nGitHub shows new commit and feedback in the \"unified Pull Request view\".\nDeploy\nWhen the pull request has been reviewed and everything looks good, it is time for the final testing.\nGitHub allows you to deploy from a branch for final testing in production before merging with the master branch.\nIf any issues arise, you can undo the changes by deploying the master branch into production again!\nNote:\nTeams often have dedicated testing environments used for deploying branches.\nMerge\nAfter exhaustive testing, you can merge the code into the master branch!\nPull Requests keep records of changes to your code, and if you commented and named changes well, you can go back and understand why changes and decisions were made.\nNote:\nYou can add keywords to your pull request for easier searching!\n\n\u2605\n+1",
