It\u2019s useful when you want just one (or a few) changes, not everything from another branch.\nWhat is a Patch?\nA\npatch\nis a file with changes from one or more commits. You can share a patch or apply it to another repository, even if it\u2019s unrelated to your own.\nWhen to Use Each\nUse\ncherry-pick\nto copy a commit between branches in the same repository.\nUse\npatches\nto share changes as files, or when working across different repositories.\nHow to Cherry-pick a Commit\nCopy a specific commit from another branch to your current branch:\nExample: Cherry-pick a Commit\ngit cherry-pick abc1234\nThis creates a new commit on your branch with the same changes.",
