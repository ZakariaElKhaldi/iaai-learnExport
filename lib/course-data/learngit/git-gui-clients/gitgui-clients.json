See changes in the app\n4. Stage and commit with a message\n5. Push to GitHub with one click\nGitKraken\nGitKraken\nis a powerful, cross-platform Git client with a modern interface.\nIt supports GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and more.\nPros:\nVisual commit graph, built-in merge/conflict tools, works with many platforms.\nCons:\nSome features require a paid license.\nExample workflow\n1. Open a repository\n2. Drag and drop to create branches\n3. View history and merge visually\n4. Resolve conflicts with built-in tools\n5. Push changes to remote\nSourcetree\nSourcetree\nis a free Git client from Atlassian, popular for Bitbucket but works with any Git repository.\nPros:\nFree, full-featured, good for advanced users.\nCons:\nInterface can be overwhelming for beginners.\nExample workflow\n1. Add a repository\n2. Stage and commit changes\n3. Use the log/history view to see all commits\n4. Push and pull with buttons\nGit GUI\nGit GUI\nis a basic graphical tool that comes with Git for Windows.\nIt's simple, but covers the basics.\nPros:\nAlways available, lightweight, no extra install needed.\nCons:\nBasic interface, fewer features than other clients.\nExample workflow\n1. Open Git GUI from the Start menu\n2. Select your repository folder\n3. Stage files, write a commit message, and commit\n4. Push to remote using the menu\nVS Code Git\nVisual Studio Code\nhas built-in Git support.\nYou can use the Source Control panel to stage, commit, push, pull, and resolve conflicts\u2014all inside your code editor.\nPros:\nIntegrated with your editor, easy to use, works with extensions.\nCons:\nNot as visual for history/branches as dedicated apps.\nExample workflow\n1.
