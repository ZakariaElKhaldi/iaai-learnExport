Use\ngit add <file>\nfor precision.\nPush regularly to back up your work and share with others.\nReview your changes with\ngit diff\nbefore committing.\nWorking Directory\nThis is where you make changes to your files.\nThink of it as your workspace or desk.\nFiles here can be new, modified, or deleted, but Git won't save these changes until you stage and commit them.\nStaging Changes (\ngit add\n)\nWhen you are happy with your changes, you \"stage\" them with\ngit add\n.\nThis puts your changes in the Staging Area, like putting your finished letter in an envelope.\nExample\ngit add index.html\nTo stage all changes (new, modified, and deleted files):\ngit add .\nCommitting Changes (\ngit commit\n)\nCommitting saves your staged changes to your local repository.\nIt's like mailing your letter\u2014you can't change it after it's sent!\nExample\ngit commit -m \"Describe your changes\"\nYou can also use\ngit commit -a -m \"message\"\nto stage and commit all modified and deleted files in one step (but not new files).\nPushing Changes (\ngit push\n)\nAfter you commit, your changes are only in your local repository.\nUse\ngit push\nto send your commits to a remote repository (like GitHub or Bitbucket) so others can see them.\nExample\ngit push\nChecking Status (\ngit status\n)\nUse\ngit status\nto see which files are staged, unstaged, or untracked.\nThis helps you keep track of what you still need to add or commit.\nExample\ngit status\nUndoing and Amending Changes\nMade a mistake? Git lets you fix things before you push!\ngit restore <file>\n- Undo changes in your working directory (before staging).\ngit restore --staged <file>\n- Unstage a file (move it out of the Staging Area).\ngit reset HEAD~\n- Undo your last commit (keeps changes in your working directory).\ngit commit --amend\n- Change the last commit message or add files to your last commit.\nExample: Unstage a file\ngit restore --staged index.html\nTips & Troubleshooting\nUse\ngit status\noften to see what's going on.\nIf you commit the wrong thing, use\ngit reset\nor\ngit commit --amend\nbefore pushing.\nStage only what you want to commit\u2014use\ngit add <filename>\nfor specific files.\nDon't forget to push after committing, or your changes won't show up for others.\nIf you're not sure, ask for help or look up the error message\u2014everyone makes mistakes!\n\n\u2605\n+1",
