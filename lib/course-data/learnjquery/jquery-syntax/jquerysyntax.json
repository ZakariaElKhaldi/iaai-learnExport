You will learn more about the selector syntax in the \nTip:\nIf you don't know CSS, you can read our\nCSS Tutorial\n.\nThe Document Ready Event\nYou might have noticed that all jQuery methods in our examples, are inside a document ready event:\n$(document).ready(function(){\n// jQuery methods go here...\n});\nThis is to prevent any jQuery code from running before the document is finished loading (is ready).\nIt is good practice to wait for the document to be fully loaded and ready before working with it.\nThis also allows you to have your JavaScript code before the body of your document, in the head section.\nHere are some examples of actions that can fail if methods are run before the document is fully loaded:\nTrying to hide an element that is not created yet\nTrying to get the size of an image that is not loaded yet\nTip:\nThe jQuery team has also created an even shorter method for the \ndocument ready event:\n$(function(){\n// jQuery methods go here...\n});\nUse the syntax you prefer. We think that the document ready event is easier to understand when reading the code.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
