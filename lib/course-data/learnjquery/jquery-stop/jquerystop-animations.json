Default is false, which means that only the active \nanimation will be stopped, allowing any queued animations to be performed \nafterwards.\nThe optional goToEnd parameter specifies whether or \nnot to complete the current animation immediately. Default is false.\nSo, by default, the\nstop()\nmethod kills the current animation being performed \non the selected element.\nThe following example demonstrates the\nstop()\nmethod, with no parameters:\nExample\n$(\"#stop\").click(function(){\n$(\"#panel\").stop();\n});\n\njQuery Exercises\nTest Yourself With Exercises\nExercise:\nUse a jQuery method to\nstop\nthe animation effect of a <div> element.\n$(\"div\").\n();\nSubmit Answer \u00bb\nStart the Exercise\njQuery Effects Reference\nFor a complete overview of all jQuery effects, please go to our\njQuery Effect Reference\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
