      "content": "With jQuery, you can chain together actions/methods.\nChaining allows us to run multiple jQuery methods (on the same \nelement) within a single statement.\njQuery Method Chaining\nUntil now we have been writing jQuery statements one at a time (one after the \nother).\nHowever, there is a technique called chaining, that \nallows us to run multiple jQuery commands, one after the other, on the same \nelement(s).\nTip:\nThis way, browsers do not have to find the same element(s) more than once.\nTo chain \nan action, you simply append the action to the \nThe following example chains together the\ncss()\n,\nslideUp()\n, and\nslideDown()\nmethods. The \"p1\" element first changes to red, then it slides up, and then it \nslides down:\nExample\n$(\"#p1\").css(\"color\", \"red\").slideUp(2000).slideDown(2000);\n\nWe could also have added more method calls if needed.\nTip\n: When chaining, the line of code \ncould become quite long. However, jQuery is not very strict on the syntax; you can format it like you want, including line breaks and indentations.\nThis also works just fine:\nExample\n$(\"#p1\").css(\"color\", \"red\")\n.slideUp(2000)\n.slideDown(2000);\n\njQuery throws away extra whitespace and executes the lines above as one long line of code.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
