      "content": "Why\nButtons and links are specific types of interactive components. Each of them work differently with assistive technologies. The correct use of each component helps users with assistive technologies to interact with the component.\nWhat\nThe\n<button> element\nshould be used for any interaction that performs\nan action on the current page\n. The\n<a> element\nshould be used for any interaction that\nnavigates to another view\n.\nAngular Material, Button\nHow\nIn the\nintroduction\n, we saw that the visual design does not dictate which HTML element we should use. A link that looks like a button, but behaves like a link, is an\n<a>\n.\nBoth the \"button\"\n\nand the link underneath is coded as an\n<a>\n. So when should we use a\n<button>\n, then?\nLet us take a closer look at the\nwebsite of Uber\n. The first section of the header has five elements \u2013 a logo, a dropdown menu and three links. One of them is coded as a\n<button>\n.\nClicking\nCompany\nopens a drop down menu. This is an interaction that performs an action on the current page. Using\n<button>\nhere is the correct thing to do. The underlying links, About us, Our offerings and so on, are correctly coded with\n<a>\nelements.\nThe arrow indicates that this is a button with a dropdown menu, that changes direction when opened. This is a nice extra visual cue.\nOne benefit with this, is that semantic HTML gives context to screen readers, which read the contents of a page out loud. You will learn more about\nscreen readers\nin module 7 about assistive technologies.\nIn this case, a\n<div>\nis wrong. Why?\nButtons have more suitable styling by default.\nA screen reader identifies it as a button.\nIt is focusable.\nIt is clickable.\nBoth a link and a button are accessible for people relying on keyboard-only navigation; it can be clickable with both mouse and keys, and it can be tabbed between using the tab key on the keyboard.\nNow you know when to use a\n<button>\nand when to use an\n<a>\n. What else should you keep in mind?\nProper links\nLinks take users from one page to another, or sometimes to another part of the page. For a link to be accessible, remember to:\nUse the\nhref\nattribute to specify the link destination.\nUse a proper URL in the\nhref\nattribute. The URL can be absolute or relative. https://uber.com/about is an absolute URL. /about is a relative URL.\nNot simulate a link with other elements like\n<span>\nor\n<div>\n.\nOpen the link in the current window. It is\nnot recommended to open links in a new window\n.\nThe link\nAbout\nus from the Uber example is coded like this, a bit simplified:\n<a href=\"/about/\">About us</a>\nThis is a proper and healthy link.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
