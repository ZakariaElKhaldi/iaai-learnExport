      "content": "Why\nScreen readers are necessary for blind people, important for partially-sighted users and helpful for people with reading disorders.\nWhat\nIt is hard to teach about web accessibility without talking about screen readers. Screen readers has become for web accessibility what wheel chairs is for accessibility. Even though it is\na myth that accessibility is just for blind or partially-sighted users\n, screen reader support is a mandatory topic.\nIf you have done everything you have learned in this course, your site should probably work well in screen readers. That does not necessarily mean that all blind users are able to use it.\nAs the name implies, a screen reader is a tool that reads your screen. Necessary for blind people, important for partially-sighted users and helpful for people with reading disorders.\nMost common screen readers\nYou will learn the name of four different screen readers.\nMobile\nFor mobile devices, Apple has the biggest share of screen reader users. The screen reader VoiceOver is built in on iOS. The second most popular is TalkBack for Android, also built in on all Android devices.\nMaking sure your site works well with these two is a good starting point. Before we proceed, read these articles:\nGet started on Android with TalkBack\nTurn on and practice VoiceOver on iPhone\nDesktop and laptop\nFor desktop and laptop computers, there is two screen readers you should be aware of \u2013\nNVDA\nand\nJAWS\n. If you have to choose one for testing, go for NVDA. It is free and its popularity is growing. Both are only available for Windows.\nHow\nYou will to set the language, and we will test two websites \u2013 Toyota and Hyundai.\nLanguage\nFor the screen reader to speak the correct language, it needs to know what language your content is. This is done with the lang attribute in the\n<html>\nelement. The following example specifies English as the language:\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\nCheck the source code of the english\nWikipedia article about Dyslexia\n.\nClick the language\nBahasa Indonesia\n.\nCheck the source code again.\nThe lang attribute changed from\nlang=\"en\"\nto\nlang=\"id\"\n. Good for screen readers and good for search engines.\nLanguage of parts\nSometimes parts of your content is in another language. To make screen readers change their language in the middle of the page, we use the same lang attribute. Check the source code of the link to Bahasa Indonesia on the\nenglish page about Dyslexia\n:\n<a href=\"\" lang=\"id\" hreflang=\"id\">Bahasa Indonesia</a>\nNow the screen reader understands that the words \"Bahasa Indonesia\" should be read in the language Bahasa Indonesia, not \nEnglish. It also understand that the target page is in Bahasa Indonesian because of the hreflang attribute.\nScreen reader testing\nLet's scratch the surface of screen reader testing. In this course, we will not dig deep. Screen readers is a big topic. Use your phone to follow these two examples. You might not hear exactly what's written here, there are many factors that affect the screen reader output.\nToyota\nOpen\ntoyota.com\nin your browser and turn on TalkBack or VoiceOver. On Android, use Chrome. On iOS, use Safari.\nSwipe from left to right, to reach the first element on the front page. You will hear something like \"Skip to main content \u2026\". Good, a\nskip link\n!\nSwipe to the \n<title>Toyota</title>\n.\nSwipe to the\n\nAfter hearing the logo, you probably got lost. Three buttons without accessible names. As you learned in the page\nRole, Name and Value\n, all elements must have an accessible name.\nHow to improve this experience\nBetter label on navigation landmark. As you have learned in\nLandmarks\n, you must use\naria-label\nif you have more than one of each landmark. Toyota has more than one\n<nav>\n, so they have used\naria-label\nlike they should. However, the value of the attribute should be written for humans without hyphens.\n<nav aria-label=\"main\">\nwould be better.\nBetter link name on logo. As you learned in\nLink Text\n, a link text should explain clearly what information the reader will get by clicking on that link. This can be improved by using\naria-label=\"Toyota front page\"\non the\n<a>\n.\nThe first \"Button\" is a <input type=\"button\"> without an accessible name. It opens a modal asking for a zip code to find Toyota dealers nearby. This can be fixed by using\naria-label=\"Enter zip code to find a dealer nearby\"\non the\n<input>\n.\nThe second \"Button\" is related to the zip code button. It has a geolocation icon. From an accessibility point of view, these two elements should be merged into one.\nThe third \"Button\" is the hamburger icon. A\naria-label=\"Open menu\"\nwould make this accessible.\nThese small changes would improve the Toyota site, not fix it. Using components like modals and menus requires other considerations as well. This course will not go into details about custom components. If you want to learn more about patterns like these, please visit\nWAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1\nto read about\nmenu button\n,\nmodal\nand\ncarousel\n.\nHyundai\nOpen\nHyundai Worldwide\nturn on your screen reader.\nSwipe from left to right, to reach the first element on the front page. \"Go to menu\". Good, a\nskip link\n!\nSwipe to the\n\nOverall, the top part of the page is accessible for screen reader users. The following tips are small improvements.\nHow to improve this experience\nThe \"Hyundai World Wide\" is a\n<span>\nfor screen readers only. It is visually hidden. The intentions is to tell the user the title of the current page. This is redundant because of the\n<title>\nelement and can be removed.\nBetter alt text on logo. Include the intention of the link:\nalt=\"Hyundai World Wide front page\"\n.\nStrip down the accessible names on links and buttons. Remove \"Go to\" and \"page\".\nGlobal distributors\nis enough.\nUse\n<a>\ninstead of\n<button>\non the Global distributors link, as we learned in\nButtons and Links\n.\nNow you have learned the basics of a screen reader. Feel free to explore other accessibility options built in your mobile device. Try to operate your phone with your face, using switch controls.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
