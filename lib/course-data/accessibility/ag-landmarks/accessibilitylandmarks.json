      "content": "Why\nWith landmarks, blind users using a\nscreen reader\nhave the ability to jump to sections of a web page.\nWhat\nIn HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:\n<header>\n<nav>\n<main>\n<aside>\n<section>\n<footer>\nHow - Example from The White House\nThe front page of The White House is using landmarks. It consists of a\n<header>\nat the top, a\n<main>\ncontaining all the main content and a\n<footer>\nwith some\n<nav>\nelements at the bottom.\nOne way to visualize landmarks is to use the tool\nAccessibility Insights\n. One of the features is that it highlights the landmarks, as we can see in the following screenshot.\n\nAccessibility Insights\nand turn on the landmark visualization. Is your favorite site using landmarks?\nRoles\nBut wait, it shows\nbanner\n,\ncontentinfo\nand\nnavigation\n. This is a bit confusing. The reason is that each landmark element has a corresponding role. We have not talked about roles in this course so far. We will get back to this, but as a simplified explanation:\nA\n<header>\nhas a built in role of banner. This means that both\n<header>\n,\n<header role=\"banner\">\nand\n<div role=\"banner\">\nare more or less equivalent. For most cases,\n<header>\nwill be sufficient.\nThe same is true for\n<nav>\n, which has\nrole=\"navigation\"\nbuilt in.\n<main>\nis easier, it has\nrole=\"main\"\n. And then we have\n<footer>\nwith its\nrole=\"contentinfo\"\n. Let us leave the roles for now.\nMore than one of each landmark\nA rule of thumb is to only use one\n<main>\nper page. When we use more than one type of landmark, like multiple\n<nav>\ns like in this example, we must label each of them. This is done with the attribute\naria-label\n.\nIn the footer of The White House, we have three\n<nav>\ns, each with an\naria-label\n, like\naria-label=\"social navigation\"\n. This means that a screen reader user can skip directly to the social navigation. A helping hand. Some will say that to use the wording \"navigation\" as a part of the label of a\n<nav>\nis redundant. There is no right and wrong, but\naria-label=\"social\"\nshould be fine.\nThe\n<aside>\nand\n<section>\ntags\nEver since the landmarks were introduced to HTML, developers have been confused. Two of the elements that people find vaguely defined are\n<aside>\nand\n<section>\n. Let us try to clarify a bit. The big difference is that an <aside> is related to the main content and the\n<section>\nis\nnot\nrelated.\nThe contact page of The White House uses both an\n<aside>\nand a\n<section>\n. The three sharing buttons are inside an\n<aside>\n. This makes sense, they are related to the main content. If you use them, you will share the page you are on.\nThe\nStay Connected\nis a\n<section>\n. Good. It is not related to the main content, and no other landmark will be \nappropriate. One improvement that The White House can do with these landmarks is to add labels. This will be better for a screen reader user.\n<section aria-label=\"Newsletter\">\nand\n<aside aria-label=\"Share this page\">\nwould be helpful.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
