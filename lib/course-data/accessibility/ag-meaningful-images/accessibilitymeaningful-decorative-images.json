      "content": "Why\nScreen readers\nwill ignore decorative images. Screen readers will try to speak the meaning of a meaningful image.\nWhat\nSome images are meaningful and some are decorative. This is an important distinction in terms of accessibility. Every image must be coded as meaningful or decorative.\nHow\nYou will learn how to separate meaningful from decorative images.\nDecorative images\nIf an image is not important for a user to understand the functionality or the content of a web page or app, it is considered decorative. Can you remove it with no impact? Then it is a decorative image.\nEmpty alt attribute\nThe basic way to set an image as decorative is to use an empty\nalt\nattribute.\nOn the front page of Alibaba, we have four shortcuts \u2013\nAll Categories\n,\nRequest for Quotation\n,\nOnline Trade Show\nand\nPersonal Protective Equipment\n. Each has an illustrative icon. The shortcut\nAll Categories\nhas an image showing three dark blue squares and an orange circle. This image is a decorative image. We set this by adding an empty\nalt\nattribute:\n<img src=\"Ha50044a3568449409f3396e5b36be8c3h.png_80x80q80.jpg\" alt=\"\">\nAssistive technologies, like a screen reader will then ignore the image. Without the empty\nalt\nattribute, a screen reader may read the file name. This will make no sense, and will confuse the user.\nBackground images\nAnother method for decorative images is to add them using the\nCSS background-image property\n. This is common when we create\nhero images\n.\nFont icons\nAt the bottom of the mobile version of Alibaba, we have five links that are combinations of icons and text \u2013\nHome\n,\nFeeds\n,\nMessenger\n,\nCart\nand\nMy Alibaba\n. Since the site is still readable if we remove the icons, they are decorative. The icons are created with font icons. No\n<img>\nelement and no background image. Add\nrole=\"img\"\nand\naria-hidden=\"true\"\n:\n<i class=\"navbarIcon\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>\nWith this code, we add some semantics to the\n<i>\nwith the image role. User agents now understand that this is an image. Screen readers also understand that they should ignore the image.\nInline SVG images\nIf you add a decorative SVG image with the\n<img>\nelement, you must add an empty alt attribute as described. SVG images are often inserted inline, using the\n<svg>\nelement. In this case,\naria-hidden=\"true\"\nwill make your image decorative.\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" \u2026></svg>\nMeaningful images\nMost of our images are meaningful. In this example from Alibaba, we have six images:\nLogo\nSearch icon\nCoffee\nJacket\n1 year badge\nGold badge\nThe only decorative image here is the search icon. This is decorative because of the text\nSearch Products\n. If the icon for open search had been stand-alone, it would have been a meaningful image.\nAs with decorative images, we have several methods for coding meaning images.\nDescriptive alt attribute\nThe alt attribute provides an alternative text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it. The reason can be a slow connection, an error with the image file, or if the user uses a screen reader. The value of the alt attribute should describe the image, or even better: the\nintention\nof the image. You will learn what to write in the page\nDescriptive texts for images\n.\nIn this example from Alibaba, the logo is there for two reasons. First of all, to tell the users which site they are on. Second, to provide the users a link back to the front page.\nInaccessible:\n<img src=\"TB1hVGkvVP7gK0jSZFjXXc5aXXa-365-49.svg\">\nBetter, but still bad:\n<img src=\"alibaba-logo.svg\">\nBetter:\n<img src=\"alibaba-logo.svg\" alt=\"Alibaba logo\">\nBest:\n<img src=\"alibaba-logo.svg\" alt=\"Home of Alibaba\">\nBackground images, font icons and <svg> images\nThe method are the same for both background images, font icons and\n<svg>\n:\nAdd\nrole=\"img\"\nAdd a descriptive\naria-label\nor\naria-labelledby\nattribute.\n<div role=\"img\" aria-label=\"Private house, modern architecture. Minimalistic with a big garage.\">\nNow you know how to code decorative and meaningful images. \ndescriptive text\nfor meaningful images.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
