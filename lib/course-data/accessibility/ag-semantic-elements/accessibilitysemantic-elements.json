      "content": "Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.\nProvide the user a good way to navigate and interact with your site. Make your HTML semantic. Semantics is about using the correct element in HTML. There are approximately 110 elements in HTML 5.\nTwo of them have no meaning \u2013\n<div>\nand\n<span>\n. They tell us nothing about the content. They have no built in accessibility features, so we should always check to see if any other elements are better suited. Example of semantic elements:\n<form>\n,\n<table>\nand\n<article>\n. They clearly define the content.\nEasy example from Uber\nIn this example from Uber, we have five elements:\nA heading\nA paragraph\nA button\nA link\nAn image\nThese elements\ncan\nbe translated into HTML:\n<h2>\n<p>\n<button>\n<a>\n<img>\nIs this correct? Even though\n\nlooks like a button, Uber has used a\n<a>\ninstead of a\n<button>\n. This is the code, a bit simplified:\n<h2>Get in the driver's seat and get paid</h2>\n<p>Drive on the platform with the largest network of active riders.</p>\n<a href=\"/signup/drive/>\n<a href=\"/en/drive/\">Learn more about driving and delivering</a>\n<img src=\"driver.jpg\" alt=\"\">\nThis is semantically correct. The button is coded as a link, because it behaves like a link. It takes the user to another view. It does not matter that the link is styled as a button, it is still a link.\nThe <button> element should be used for any interaction that performs an action on the current page. The <a> element should be used for any interaction that navigates to another view.\nAngular Material, Button\nNow that you have learned the basics of semantics, let us check which semantic elements we have in our HTML toolbox.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
