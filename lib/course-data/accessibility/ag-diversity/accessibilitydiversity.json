      "content": "Diversity\nThere are close to 8 billion people in the world. According to World Health Organization, there are over\none billion people with disabilities\n. That is about 15 % of the population. Access to information is a human right.\nPhoto by\nBrittani Burns\non\nUnsplash\nThis poster says it all. People are different. People are diverse. We must welcome everyone regardless of race, religion, country of origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability and disabilities, spoken language or age. We think that web accessibility is about abilities and disabilities. It is also about spoken languages. Is your content written in an easily understandable way for people with a different language background? Have you avoided text in images, so that all text is translatable? It is also about age. With age comes challenges. Technical challenges. Cognitive challenges. Mobility challenges.\nDiversity of abilities\nA disability is not a yes or a no. All people for many different reasons experience varying degrees of auditory, cognitive, physical, speech and visual disabilities. We grow older. Our health conditions change. We have good and bad days. We get ill. We have temporary impairments due to accidents, surgeries and medication. We have situational limitations due to our surroundings and situations. The spectrum is large.\nGroups of disabilities\nDisabilities can be categorized into five groups:\nAuditory\nPeople with hearing loss. Remember transcripts for audio and captions for video.\nCognitive, learning and neurological\nPeople that may have challenges understanding information. Remember a clear structure, consistent labeling, predictable links and plain language. This helps everyone regardless of ability or disability.\nPhysical\nPeople with limitations in their muscular control, sensations, joint \ndisorders or missing limbs. Remember to support\nassistive technologies\nlike switches and voice recognition and to have sufficient target sizes. Target size is the size of a interactive element, the clickable or tapable area.\nSpeech\nSome people are not able to speak. Do not make your service voice-based only.\nVisual\nPeople with reduced vision. Make sure\ntext and images can be enlarged\n, you use sufficient\ncontrast\n, that you do not rely on\ncolor alone\n, and that the content supports\ntext-to-speech\n.\nPermanent, temporary and situational disabilities\nAccessibility is not only about permanent disabilities.\nTouch\nA person with\none arm\nhas a permanent disability\nA person with a\nbroken arm\nhas a temporary disability\nA new parent\nholding a baby\non one arm has a situational \n  disability\nSee\nA\nblind\nperson has a permanent disability\nA\ncataract\ncan be temporary\nA\ndistracted driver\nhas a situational disability\nHear\nA\ndeaf\nperson has a permanent disability\nAn\near infection\nis temporary\nA\nbartender\nhas a situational disability\nSpeak\nA\nnon-verbal\nperson has a permanent disability\nA person with\nlaryngitis\nhas a temporary disability\nA person with a\nheavy accent\nhas a situational disability\nYou are not the user\nAlways remember that\nyou are not the user\n. As designers and developers, we often think that what can be used, accessed and understood by us, also is good enough for others.\nInternet IS for everyone \u2013 but it won\u2019t be unless WE make it so.\n\u2014Vint Cerf\n\n\u2605\n+1",
