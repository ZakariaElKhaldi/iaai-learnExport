They use the\nkeyboard\nto navigate.\nPeople with mobility disabilities use their\nvoice\nto control the computer or mobile device.\nPeople with mobility disabilities use\neye tracking\nto move the screen cursor.\nPeople with mobility disabilities use\nswitch devices\nto operate the computer or mobile device.\nPeople who are blind use\nscreen readers\n,\nbraille displays\nor\nspeech recognition\nsoftware.\nPeople with low vision use\nscreen magnification.\nPhoto by\nChona Kasinger\nfrom\nDisabled and Here\nThe term assistive technologies is a broad term for all these tools. As developers, we do not need to code for a particular technology. We use standards methods to make sure that our solution is accessible for all.\nIn this module, you will learn the basics of keyboard and screen reader navigation.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
