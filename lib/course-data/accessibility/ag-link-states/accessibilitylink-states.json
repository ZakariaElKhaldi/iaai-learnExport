      "content": "Why\nDifferent link states help users interact with the links. A visited state can help a person with\nshort-term memory loss\nto understand which content has been read. A hover state can help a person with\nreduced muscle control\nto know when to click. A focused link helps\nkeyboard users\nto know which link they are about to activate.\nWhat\nLinks hardly needs an introduction. They are the heart of the web. A link has many states. Here are five of the most common states. In CSS terms, these are\npseudo-classes\n:\nUnvisited\nVisited\nHover\nActive\nFocus\nHow\nTo make sure that all link states are accessible, we must remember these three tips. We will use an example from the front page of\nICRC\n, the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n1. Underline\nLinks are underlined by default. Removing the underline from a link\nin body text\nis a bad idea most of the time. We learned this in the section about\ncolor alone\n. This is most important for unvisited and visited links.\nIn the example from ICRC, there is one link in the body text \u2013\nrules of war\n. Without underline. Let us remove the text-decoration: none; from the stylesheet:\nNow the link is accessible to people with color blindness.\n2. Contrast and focus\nAll states must have sufficient contrast, as we learned in\ncolor contrast\n. In addition, a focused link must have sufficient contrast to the unfocused state.\nNow the link\nrules of war\nis in a focused state. The text has an orange outline without any offset. This focus state has two problems. First, the orange outline has low contrast compared to the white background. Second, the lack of offset makes the text hard to read. Let us use the red color that is already in the color palette of the site, and let us add some offset.\nMuch better! A focused link that is accessible for people that are using a keyboard to navigate and/or has reduced vision.\nThis improvement used the CSS properties\noutline-color\nand\noutline-offset\n.\n3. Hover\nA clear hover state is helpful for everyone, especially people with motor impairments.\nIn the footer of ICRC you can see a collection of quick links. They have a very subtle hover state, changing the color from light grey to white. This effect can be improved.\nIn this example we have added one effect for the hover state, bold text. It is now clearer what action the user is about to do.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
