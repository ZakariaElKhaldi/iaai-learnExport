      "content": "Why\nThe autocomplete attribute makes a form\neasier and more efficient for all users\n, especially users that are attention deficit, have cognitive impairments, reduced mobility, low vision or blind users.\nWhat\nHave you ever experienced coming to a web form, and your browser autofill the fields in magical way? That is either because the browser was smart, or that the form author had used the\nautocomplete\nattribute in correct way.\nThis is convenient for everybody. This is very helpful for user with motor impairments or cognitive disabilities. Filling a form can be hard, and the\nautocomplete\nattribute is often a helping hand.\nHow\nAutocomplete can be used on\n<input>\n,\n<textarea>\n,\n<select>\nand\n<form>\nelements. The attribute has many possible values, like:\n\"name\": Daniel Zhang\n\"given name\": Daniel\n\"family name\": Zhang\n\"organization\": Alibaba Group\n\"country-name\": China\n\"street-address\": 699 Wang Shang Road\nThe complete list of values:\nInput Purposes for User Interface Components\n.\nExample: A registration form\nThis registration form has fields for email and birthday. A great opportunity to provide autofill. Many users have these details saved in their browser, ready for an autocomplete enabled form. The browser needs to understand the purpose of the fields.\nA label and a placeholder is a hint for some browsers, but not a bulletproof solution. The best way is to add the magical\nautocomplete\nattribute:\n<input id=\"email\"\nautocomplete=\"email\"\nname=\"email\" aria-required=\"true\" placeholder=\"Email\" required>\n<select id=\"dobDay\"\nautocomplete=\"bday-day\"\naria-required=\"true\" required>\n<select id=\"dobMonth\"\nautocomplete=\"bday-month\"\naria-required=\"true\" required>\n<input id=\"dobYear\"\nautocomplete=\"bday-year\"\nplaceholder=\"YYYY\" aria-required=\"true\" required>\nExceptions\nNo rules without exceptions. The above code example will make the form easy, efficient, error free and accessible. If the form was asking for another email, not \"\nyour\"\nemail, it would make no sense to add the autocomplete attribute. When the data is probably not saved in the browser, it shouldn\u2019t have attribute.\nNot all forms are error free. How do you code accessible\nerror messages\n. Read on!\n\n\u2605\n+1",
