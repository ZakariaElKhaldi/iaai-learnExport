      "content": "Why\nNot everyone perceives color the same way.\nRed-green color blindness is the most common form\n, it affects up to 8% of males. Some use\ngrayscale mode to curb their phone addiction\n.\nWhat\nDo not use color as the\nonly\nvisual indicator of a meaning.\nThe most common example of this is to style links without underline or border.\nBrowsers underline hypertext links by default. It is possible to remove the underline using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), but this is a bad idea most of the time. Users are accustomed to seeing links underlined.\nWebAIM:\nLinks and Hypertext\nWikipedia is one example where color alone is used for styling links. In the grayscale version of the site, it is not possible to see what is plain text and what is a link.\nHow\nUnderlined links\nAdd underline to links. Or, do not remove them. Keep in mind that they can reduce readability.\nThis modified version of Wikipedia has links with underline. Some will say that this is visual noise that reduces readability.\nTo improve readability, we can use CSS properties like\ntext-underline-offset\nand\ntext-decoration-color\n.\nThis modified version is using\ntext-underline-offset\nand\ntext-decoration-color\nto improve readability.\nColor as status\nAdd text and/or icons to communicate meaning, in addition to color.\nTools\nNote:\nThe following tools gives a rating for the contrast assuming that you are using it as text color.\nMany combinations that are not suitable as background/color combinations, are perfectly usable as colors for graphics, buttons, etc.\nThe tool\nContrast Ratio\nuses color to communicate if a\ncolor contrast\nis good or not. Red means bad contrast. In this example you might say that the number is another indicator. That is a valid argument. However, you are then assuming that the user understands the metric contrast ratio and knows about the guidelines.\nThe tool\nCoolors Color Contrast Checker\nuses three methods to tell us whether or not a color combination is good:\nThe red color tells us that the contrast is bad.\nThe text\nVery poor\ntells us that the contrast is b\u2026 very poor.\n1 of 5 stars tells us that this is really bad.\nDo not rely on color alone. Do like Coolors, use two or three methods.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
