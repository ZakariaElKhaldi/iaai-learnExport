      "content": "The\nforeach\nloop - Loops \nthrough a block of code for each element in an array or each property in an object.\nThe foreach Loop on Arrays\nThe most common use of the\nforeach\nloop, is \nto loop through the items of an array.\nExample\nLoop through the items of an indexed array:\n$colors = array(\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\", \"yellow\");\n\nforeach ($colors as $x) {\n  echo \"$x <br>\";\n}\n\nFor every loop iteration, the value of the current array element is assigned to\nthe variable\n$x\n.\nThe iteration continues until it reaches the last array element.\nKeys and Values\nThe array above is an\nindexed\narray, where the first item has the key 0, the second has the key 1, and so on.\nAssociative\narrays are different,\nassociative arrays use named keys that you assign to them, and when looping through associative arrays, \nyou might want to keep the key as well as the value.\nThis can be done by specifying both the key and value in the\nforeach\ndefinition, like this:\nExample\nPrint both the key and the value from the\n$members\narray:\n$members = array(\"Peter\"=>\"35\", \"Ben\"=>\"37\", \"Joe\"=>\"43\");\n\nforeach ($members as $x => $y) {\n  echo \"$x : $y <br>\";\n}\n\nYou will learn more about arrays in the\nPHP Arrays\nchapter.\nThe foreach Loop on Objects\nThe\nforeach\nloop can also be used to loop through properties of an object:\nExample\nPrint the property names and values of the\n$myCar\nobject:\nclass Car {\n  public $color;\n  public $model;\n  public function __construct($color, $model) {\n    $this->color = $color;\n    $this->model = $model;\n  }\n}\n\n$myCar = new Car(\"red\", \"Volvo\");\n\nforeach ($myCar as $x => $y) {\n  echo \"$x: $y <br>\";\n}\n\nYou will learn more about objects in the\nPHP Objects and Classes\nchapter.\nThe break Statement\nWith the\nbreak\nstatement we can stop the loop even if it has not reached the end:\nExample\nStop the loop if\n$x\nis \"blue\":\n$colors = array(\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\", \"yellow\");\n\nforeach ($colors as $x) {\n  if ($x == \"blue\") break;\n  echo \"$x <br>\";\n}\n\nThe continue Statement\nWith the\ncontinue\nstatement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the \nExample\nStop, and jump to the \n$x\nis \"blue\":\n$colors = array(\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\", \"yellow\");\n\nforeach ($colors as $x) {\n  if ($x == \"blue\") continue;\n  echo \"$x <br>\";\n}\n\nForeach Byref\nWhen looping through the array items,\nany changes done to the array item will, by default, NOT affect the original array:\nExample\nBy default, changing an array item will not affect the original array:\n$colors = array(\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\", \"yellow\");\n\nforeach ($colors as $x) {\n  if ($x == \"blue\") $x = \"pink\";\n}\n\nvar_dump($colors);\n\nBUT, by using the\n&\ncharacter in the\nforeach\ndeclaration, the array item is assigned\nby reference\n,\nwhich results in any changes done to the array item will also be done to the original array:\nExample\nBy assigning the array items\nby reference\n, changes will affect the original array:\n$colors = array(\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\", \"yellow\");\n\nforeach ($colors as &$x) {\n  if ($x == \"blue\") $x = \"pink\";\n}\n\nvar_dump($colors);\n\nAlternative Syntax\nThe\nforeach\nloop syntax can also be written with the\nendforeach\nstatement like this\nExample\nLoop through the items of an indexed array:\n$colors = array(\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\", \"yellow\");\n\nforeach ($colors as $x) :\n  echo \"$x <br>\";\nendforeach;\n\n\u2605\n+1",
