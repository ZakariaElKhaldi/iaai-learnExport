So, this chapter contains a little more info about those two output \nstatements.\nPHP echo and print Statements\necho\nand\nprint\nare more or less the same. They are both used to output data \nto the screen.\nThe differences are small:\necho\nhas no return value while\nprint\nhas a return value of 1 so it can be used in \nexpressions.\necho\ncan take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) \nwhile\nprint\ncan take one argument.\necho\nis marginally \nfaster than\nprint\n.\nThe PHP echo Statement\nThe\necho\nstatement can be used with or without parentheses:\necho\nor\necho()\n.\nExample\necho \"Hello\";\n//same as:\necho(\"Hello\");\n\nDisplay Text\nThe following example shows how to output text with the\necho\ncommand (notice that the text can contain HTML markup):\nExample\necho \"<h2>PHP is Fun!</h2>\";\necho \"Hello world!<br>\";\necho \"I'm about to learn PHP!<br>\";\necho \"This \", \"string \", \"was \", \"made \", \"with multiple parameters.\";\n\nDisplay Variables\nThe following example shows how to output text and variables with the\necho\nstatement:\nExample\n$txt1 = \"Learn PHP\";\n$txt2 = \".com\";\n\necho \"<h2>$txt1</h2>\";\necho \"<p>Study PHP at $txt2</p>\";\n\nUsing Single Quotes\nStrings are surrounded by quotes, but there is a difference between single \nand double quotes in PHP.\nWhen using double quotes, variables can be inserted to the string as in the \nexample above.\nWhen using single quotes, variables have to be inserted using the\n.\noperator, like this:\nExample\n$txt1 = \"Learn PHP\";\n$txt2 = \".com\";\n\necho '<h2>' . $txt1 . '</h2>';\necho '<p>Study PHP at ' . $txt2 . '</p>';\n\nThe PHP print Statement\nThe\nprint\nstatement can be used with or without \nparentheses:\nprint\nor\nprint()\n.\nExample\nprint \"Hello\";\n//same as:\nprint(\"Hello\");\n\nDisplay Text\nThe following example shows how to output text with the\nprint\ncommand (notice that the text can contain HTML markup):\nExample\nprint \"<h2>PHP is Fun!</h2>\";\nprint \"Hello world!<br>\";\nprint \"I'm about to learn PHP!\";\n\nDisplay Variables\nThe following example shows how to output text and variables with the\nprint\nstatement:\nExample\n$txt1 = \"Learn PHP\";\n$txt2 = \".com\";\n\nprint \"<h2>$txt1</h2>\";\nprint \"<p>Study PHP at $txt2</p>\";\n\nUsing Single Quotes\nStrings are surrounded by quotes, but there is a difference between single \nand double quotes in PHP.\nWhen using double quotes, variables can be inserted to the string as in the \nexample above.\nWhen using single quotes, variables have to be inserted using the\n.\noperator, like this:\nExample\n$txt1 = \"Learn PHP\";\n$txt2 = \".com\";\n\nprint '<h2>' . $txt1 .
