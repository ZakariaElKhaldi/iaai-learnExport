When enabled, implicit flushing sends output directly\nto the browser as soon as it is produced so that calls to the\nflush()\nfunction are not\nneeded.\nSyntax\nob_implicit_flush(flag);\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\nflag\nWhen set to 1, implicit flushing is turned on. When set to 0, implicit flushing is turned off.\nTechnical Details\nPHP Version:\n4+\n\n\u2605\n+1",
