      "content": "In this chapter we will teach you how to open, read, and close a file \non the server.\nPHP Open File - fopen()\nA better method to open files is with the\nfopen()\nfunction. This function gives you more \noptions than the\nreadfile()\nfunction.\nWe will use the text file, \"webdictionary.txt\", during the lessons:\nAJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML\nCSS = Cascading Style Sheets\nHTML = Hyper Text Markup Language\nPHP = PHP Hypertext Preprocessor\nSQL = Structured Query Language\nSVG = Scalable Vector Graphics\nXML = EXtensible Markup Language\nThe first parameter of\nfopen()\ncontains the name of the file to be opened and the \nsecond parameter specifies in which mode the file should be opened. The following example \nalso generates a message if the fopen() function is unable to open the specified file:\nExample\n<?php\n$myfile = fopen(\"webdictionary.txt\", \"r\") or die(\"Unable to open file!\");\necho fread($myfile,filesize(\"webdictionary.txt\"));\nfclose($myfile);\n?>\nRun example \u00bb\nTip:\nThe\nfread()\nand the\nfclose()\nfunctions will be \nexplained below.\nThe file may be opened in one of the following modes:\nModes\nDescription\nr\nOpen a file for read only\n. File pointer starts at the beginning of the file\nw\nOpen a file for write only\n. Erases the contents of the file or creates a new file if it doesn't exist. File pointer starts at the beginning of the file\na\nOpen a file for write only\n. The existing data in file is preserved. File pointer starts at the end of the file. Creates a new file if the file doesn't exist\nx\nCreates a new file for write only\n. Returns FALSE and an error if file already exists\nr+\nOpen a file for read/write\n. File pointer starts at the beginning of the file\nw+\nOpen a file for read/write\n. Erases the contents of the file or creates a new file if it doesn't exist. File pointer starts at the beginning of the file\na+\nOpen a file for read/write\n. The existing data in file is preserved. File pointer starts at the end of the file. Creates a new file if the file doesn't exist\nx+\nCreates a new file for read/write\n. Returns FALSE and an error if file already exists\nPHP Read File - fread()\nThe\nfread()\nfunction reads from an open file.\nThe first parameter of\nfread()\ncontains the name of the file to read from and \nthe second parameter specifies the maximum number of bytes to read.\nThe following PHP code reads the \"webdictionary.txt\" file to the end:\nfread($myfile,filesize(\"webdictionary.txt\"));\nPHP Close File - fclose()\nThe\nfclose()\nfunction is used to close an open file.\nIt's a good programming practice to close all files after you have finished with them. \nYou don't want an open file running around on your \nserver taking up resources!\nThe\nfclose()\nrequires the name of the file (or a variable that holds the \nfilename) we want to close:\n<?php\n$myfile = fopen(\"webdictionary.txt\", \"r\");\n// some code to be executed....\nfclose($myfile);\n?>\nPHP Read Single Line - fgets()\nThe\nfgets()\nfunction is used to read a single line from a file.\nThe example below outputs the first line of the \"webdictionary.txt\" file:\nExample\n<?php\n$myfile = fopen(\"webdictionary.txt\", \"r\") or die(\"Unable to open file!\");\necho fgets($myfile);\nfclose($myfile);\n?>\nRun example \u00bb\nNote:\nAfter a call to the\nfgets()\nfunction, the file pointer has moved to the \nPHP Check End-Of-File - feof()\nThe\nfeof()\nfunction checks if the \"end-of-file\" (EOF) has been reached.\nThe\nfeof()\nfunction is useful for looping through data of unknown length.\nThe example below reads the \"webdictionary.txt\" file line by line, until end-of-file is reached:\nExample\n<?php\n$myfile = fopen(\"webdictionary.txt\", \"r\") or die(\"Unable to open file!\");\n// Output one line until end-of-file\nwhile(!feof($myfile)) {\necho fgets($myfile) . \"<br>\";\n}\nfclose($myfile);\n?>\nRun example \u00bb\nPHP Read Single Character - fgetc()\nThe\nfgetc()\nfunction is used to read a single character from a file.\nThe example below reads the \"webdictionary.txt\" file character by \ncharacter, until end-of-file is reached:\nExample\n<?php\n$myfile = fopen(\"webdictionary.txt\", \"r\") or die(\"Unable to open file!\");\n// Output one character until end-of-file\nwhile(!feof($myfile)) {\necho fgetc($myfile);\n}\nfclose($myfile);\n?>\nRun example \u00bb\nNote:\nAfter a call to the\nfgetc()\nfunction, the file pointer moves to the \nComplete PHP Filesystem Reference\nFor a complete reference of filesystem functions, go to our complete\nPHP Filesystem Reference\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
