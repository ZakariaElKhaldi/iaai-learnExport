The string to be checked\nmode\nOptional. Specifies the return modes. 0 is default. The different return modes are:\n0 - an array with the ASCII value as key and number of occurrences as value\n1 - an array with the ASCII value as key and number of occurrences as value, only lists occurrences greater than zero\n2 - an array with the ASCII value as key and number of occurrences as value, only lists occurrences equal to zero are listed\n3 - a string with all the different characters used\n4 - a string with all the unused characters\nTechnical Details\nReturn Value:\nDepending on the specified\nmode\nparameter\nPHP Version:\n4+\nMore Examples\nExample\nReturn a string with all the unused characters in \"Hello World!\" (mode 4):\n<?php\n$str = \"Hello World!\";\necho count_chars($str,4);\n?>\n\nExample\nIn this example we will use count_chars() with mode 1 to check the string. \nMode 1 will return an array with the ASCII value as key and how many times it \noccurred as value:\n<?php\n$str = \"Hello World!\";\nprint_r(count_chars($str,1));\n?>\n\nExample\nAnother example of counting how many times an ASCII character occurs in a \nstring:\n<?php\n$str = \"PHP is pretty fun!!\";\n$strArray = count_chars($str,1);\nforeach ($strArray as $key=>$value)\n{\necho \"The character <b>'\".chr($key).\"'</b> was found $value time(s)<br>\";\n}\n?>\n\n\u2605\n+1",
