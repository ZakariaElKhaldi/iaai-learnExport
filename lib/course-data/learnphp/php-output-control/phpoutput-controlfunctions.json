Output buffers catch\noutput given by the program. Each new output buffer is placed on the top of a stack of\noutput buffers, and any output it provides will be caught by the buffer below it. The output\ncontrol functions handle only the topmost buffer, so the topmost buffer must be removed in\norder to control the buffers below it.\nInstallation\nThe PHP output control functions are part of the PHP core. No installation is required to use these functions.\nRuntime Configuration\nThe behavior of output control functions is affected by settings in php.ini:\nName\nDefault\nDescription\nVersion\noutput_buffering\n\"0\"\nEnables output buffering for all PHP files by default\n4\noutput_handler\nNULL\nSet the name of the default function which handles the output of all output buffers\n4\nimplicit_flush\n\"0\"\nEnables implicit flush, which causes output to be sent directly to the browser on each output statement\n4\nurl_rewriter.tags\n\"a=href,area=href,\n    frame=src,form=,fieldset=\"\nIndicates which HTML tags and attributes can be modified by the URL rewriter (the output_add_rewrite_var() function.)\n4.3\nurl_rewriter.hosts\nThe current value of \n    $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']\nURL rewriting is only done on the server's own URLs by default. To allow for rewriting URLs of other websites, set the hostnames of the other websites here.\n7.1\nPHP Output Control Functions\nMethod\nFunction\nflush()\nAttempts to send content from the system's output buffer to the browser\nob_clean()\nDeletes all of the content from the topmost output buffer\nob_end_clean()\nDeletes the topmost output buffer and all of its contents\nob_end_flush()\nDeletes the topmost output buffer and outputs its contents\nob_flush()\nOutputs the contents of the topmost output buffer and clears the buffer\nob_get_clean()\nReturns all of the contents of the topmost output buffer and clears the buffer\nob_get_contents()\nReturns the contents of the topmost output buffer\nob_get_flush()\nOutputs and returns the contents of the topmost output buffer and then deletes the buffer\nob_get_length()\nReturns the number of bytes of data that are in the topmost output buffer\nob_get_level()\nReturns a number indicating how many output buffers are on the stack\nob_get_status()\nReturns information about the output buffers\nob_gzhandler()\nUsed as a callback function for ob_start() to compress the contents of the buffer when sending it to the browser\nob_implicit_flush()\nTurns implicit flushing on or off\nob_list_handlers()\nReturns an array of callback function names that are being used by the topmost output buffer\nob_start()\nCreates a new output buffer and adds it to the top of the stack\noutput_add_rewrite_var()\nUsed to append query string parameters to any URL in the output\noutput_reset_rewrite_vars()\nRemoves all variables added by\noutput_add_rewrite_var()\n\n\u2605\n+1",
