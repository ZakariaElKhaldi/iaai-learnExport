      "content": "PHP Data Types\nVariables can store data of different types, and different data types can do \ndifferent things.\nPHP supports the following data types:\nString\nInteger\nFloat (floating point numbers - also called double)\nBoolean\nArray\nObject\nNULL\nResource\nGetting the Data Type\nYou can get the data type of any object by using the\nvar_dump()\nfunction.\nExample\nThe\nvar_dump()\nfunction returns the data type and the value:\n$x = 5;\nvar_dump($x);\n\nPHP String\nA string is a sequence of characters, like \"Hello world!\".\nA string can be any text inside quotes. You can use single or double quotes:\nExample\n$x = \"Hello world!\";\n$y = 'Hello world!';\n\nvar_dump($x);\necho \"<br>\";\nvar_dump($y);\n\nPHP Integer\nAn integer data type is a non-decimal number between -2,147,483,648 and \n2,147,483,647.\nRules for integers:\nAn integer must have at least one digit\nAn integer must not have a decimal point\nAn integer can be either positive or negative\nIntegers can be specified in: decimal (base 10), hexadecimal (base 16), octal (base \n  8), or binary (base 2) notation\nIn the following example\n$x\nis an integer. The PHP\nvar_dump()\nfunction returns the data type and value:\nExample\n$x = 5985;\nvar_dump($x);\n\nPHP Float\nA float (floating point number) is a number with a decimal point or a number in exponential form.\nIn the following example\n$x\nis a float. The PHP\nvar_dump()\nfunction returns the data type and value:\nExample\n$x = 10.365;\nvar_dump($x);\n\nPHP Boolean\nA Boolean represents two possible states: TRUE or FALSE.\nExample\n$x = true;\nvar_dump($x);\n\nBooleans are often used in conditional testing.\nYou will learn more about \nconditional testing in the\nPHP If...Else chapter\n.\nPHP Array\nAn array stores multiple values in one single variable.\nIn the following example\n$cars\nis an array. The PHP\nvar_dump()\nfunction returns the data type and value:\nExample\n$cars = array(\"Volvo\",\"BMW\",\"Toyota\");\nvar_dump($cars);\n\nYou will learn a lot more about arrays in later chapters of this tutorial.\nPHP Object\nClasses and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.\nA class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.\nWhen the individual objects are created, they inherit all the properties and \nbehaviors from the class, but each object will have different values for the \nproperties.\nLet's assume we have a class named\nCar\nthat \ncan have properties like model, \ncolor, etc. We can define variables like\n$model\n,\n$color\n, and so on, to hold the \nvalues of these properties.\nWhen the individual objects (Volvo, BMW, Toyota, etc.) are created, they \ninherit all the properties and behaviors from the class, but each object will \nhave different values for the properties.\nIf you create a\n__construct()\nfunction, PHP will automatically call this \nfunction when you create an object from a class.\nExample\nclass Car {\n  public $color;\n  public $model;\n  public function __construct($color, $model) {\n    $this->color = $color;\n    $this->model = $model;\n  }\n  public function message() {\n    return \"My car is a \" . $this->color . \" \" . $this->model . \"!\";\n  }\n}\n\n$myCar = new Car(\"red\", \"Volvo\");\nvar_dump($myCar);\n\nDo not worry if you do not understand the PHP Object syntax, you will learn more about that in the\nPHP Classes/Objects chapter\n.\nPHP NULL Value\nNull is a special data type which can have only one value: NULL.\nA variable of data type NULL is a variable that has no value assigned to it.\nTip:\nIf a variable is created without a value, it is \nautomatically assigned a value of NULL.\nVariables can also be emptied by setting the value to NULL:\nExample\n$x = \"Hello world!\";\n$x = null;\nvar_dump($x);\n\nChange Data Type\nIf you assign an integer value to a variable, the type will automatically be an integer.\nIf you assign a string to the same variable, the type will change to a string:\nExample\n$x = 5;\nvar_dump($x);\n\n$x = \"Hello\";\nvar_dump($x);\n\nIf you want to change the data type of an existing variable, but not by \nchanging the value, you can use casting.\nCasting allows you to change data type on variables:\nExample\n$x = 5;\n$x = (string) $x;\nvar_dump($x);\n\nYou will learn more about casting in the\nPHP Casting Chapter\n.\nPHP Resource\nThe special resource type is not an actual data type. It is the storing of a \nreference to functions and resources external to PHP.\nA common example of \nusing the resource data type is a database call.\nWe will not talk about the resource type here, since it is an advanced topic.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
