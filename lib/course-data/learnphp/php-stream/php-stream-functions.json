In its simplest \ndefinition, a stream is a resource object which exhibits streamable behavior. \nThat is, it can be read from or written to in a linear fashion, and may be able \nto fseek() to an arbitrary location within the stream.\nA wrapper is \nadditional code which tells the stream how to handle specific \nprotocols/encodings.\nInstallation\nThe Stream functions are part of the PHP core. There is no installation needed to use these functions.\nPHP Stream Functions\nFunction\nDescription\nset_socket_blocking()\nDeprecated in PHP 5.4, and removed in PHP 7.0.\nAlias of stream_set_blocking()\nstream_bucket_prepend()\nstream_context_create()\nstream_context_get_default()\nstream_context_get_options()\nstream_context_get_params()\nstream_context_set_default()\nstream_context_set_options()\nstream_context_set_params()\nstream_copy_to_stream()\nCopies data from one stream to another\nstream_filter_append()\nAppends a filter to a stream\nstream_filter_prepend()\nstream_filter_register()\nstream_filter_remove()\nstream_get_contents()\nstream_get_filters()\nstream_get_line()\nstream_get_meta_data()\nstream_get_transports()\nstream_get_wrappers()\nstream_is_local()\nstream_isatty()\nstream_notification_callback()\nstream_register_wrapper()\nAlias of stream_wrapper_register()\nstream_resolve_include_path()\nstream_select()\nstream_set_blocking()\nstream_set_chunk_size()\nstream_set_read_buffer()\nstream_set_timeout()\nstream_set_write_buffer()\nstream_socket_accept()\nstream_socket_client()\nstream_socket_enable_crypto()\nstream_socket_get_name()\nstream_socket_pair()\nstream_socket_recvfrom()\nstream_socket_sendto()\nstream_socket_server()\nstream_socket_shutdown()\nstream_supports_lock()\nstream_wrapper_register()\nstream_wrapper_restore()\nstream_wrapper_unregister()\n\n\u2605\n+1",
