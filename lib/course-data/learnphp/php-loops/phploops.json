So, instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we \ncan use loops.\nLoops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as \na certain condition is true.\nIn PHP, we have the following loop types:\nwhile\n- loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true\ndo...while\n- loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop \n  as long as the specified condition is true\nfor\n- loops through a block of code a specified number of times\nforeach\n- loops through a block of code for each element in an \n  array\nThe following chapters will explain and give examples of each loop type.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
