In this example the expression\nis true as long as\n$x\nis less than, or equal to, 10.\nThe third expression,\n$x++;\n, is evaluated\nafter\neach iteration,\nand in this example, the expression increases the value of\n$x\nby\none at each iteration.\nThe break Statement\nWith the\nbreak\nstatement we can stop the loop even if the condition is still true:\nExample\nStop the loop when\n$x\nis 3:\nfor ($x = 0; $x <= 10; $x++) {\n  if ($x == 3) break;\n  echo \"The number is: $x <br>\";\n}\n\nThe continue Statement\nWith the\ncontinue\nstatement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the \nExample\nStop, and jump to the \n$x\nis 3:\nfor ($x = 0; $x <= 10; $x++) {\n  if ($x == 3) continue;\n  echo \"The number is: $x <br>\";\n}\n\nStep 10\nThis example counts to 100 by tens:\nExample\nfor ($x = 0; $x <= 100; $x+=10) {\n  echo \"The number is: $x <br>\";\n}\n\n\u2605\n+1",
