Specifies the hour\nminute\nOptional. Specifies the minute\nsecond\nOptional. Specifies the second\nmonth\nOptional. Specifies the month\nday\nOptional. Specifies the day\nyear\nOptional. Specifies the year\nis_dst\nOptional. Set this parameter to 1 if the time is during daylight savings time (DST), 0 if it is not, or -1 (the default) if it is unknown. If it's unknown, PHP tries to find out itself (which may cause unexpected results).\nNote:\nThis parameter is removed in PHP 7.0. The new timezone handling features should be used instead\nTechnical Details\nReturn Value:\nReturns an integer Unix timestamp. FALSE on error\nPHP Version:\n4+\nPHP Changelog:\nPHP 7.1: The\nis_dst\nparameter is removed.\nPHP 5.3.0: Throws E_DEPRECATED if the\nis_dst\nparameter is used\nPHP 5.1: The\nis_dst\nparameter was deprecated. If mktime() is called with no arguments, it now throws E_STRICT notice. Use the time() function instead.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
