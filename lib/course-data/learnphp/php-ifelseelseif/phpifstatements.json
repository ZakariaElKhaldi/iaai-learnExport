You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.\nIn PHP we have the following conditional statements:\nif\nstatement - executes some code if one condition is true\nif...else\nstatement - executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false\nif...elseif...else\nstatement  - executes different codes for more than two conditions\nswitch\nstatement - selects one of many blocks of code to be executed\nPHP - The if Statement\nThe\nif\nstatement executes some code if one condition is true.\nSyntax\nif (\ncondition\n) {\n// code to be executed if condition is true\n;\n}\nExample\nOutput \"Have a good day!\" if 5 is larger than 3:\nif (5 > 3) {\n  echo \"Have a good day!\";\n}\n\nWe can also use variables in the\nif\nstatement:\nExample\nOutput \"Have a good day!\" if\n$t\nis less than 20:\n$t = 14;\n\nif ($t < 20) {\n  echo \"Have a good day!\";\n}\n\n\u2605\n+1",
