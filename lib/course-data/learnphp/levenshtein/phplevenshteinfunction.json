However, you can define the cost of each operation by setting the \noptional insert, replace, and delete parameters.\nNote:\nThe levenshtein() function is not case-sensitive.\nNote:\nThe levenshtein() function is faster than the similar_text() \nfunction. However, similar_text() will give you a more accurate \nresult with less modifications needed.\nSyntax\nlevenshtein(\nstring1,string2,insert,replace,delete\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\nstring1\nRequired. First string to compare\nstring2\nRequired. Second string to compare\ninsert\nOptional. The cost of inserting a character. Default is 1\nreplace\nOptional. The cost of replacing a character. Default is 1\ndelete\nOptional. The cost of deleting a character. Default is 1\nTechnical Details\nReturn Value:\nReturns the Levenshtein distance between the two argument strings or -1, if one of the strings exceeds 255 characters\nPHP Version:\n4.0.1+\n\n\u2605\n+1",
