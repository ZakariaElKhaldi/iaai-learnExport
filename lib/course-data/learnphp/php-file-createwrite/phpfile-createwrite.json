      "content": "In this chapter we will teach you how to create and write to a file \non the server.\nPHP Create File - fopen()\nThe\nfopen()\nfunction is also used to create a file. Maybe a little confusing, but in PHP, a file is created using the same \nfunction used to open files.\nIf you use\nfopen()\non a file that does not \nexist, it will create it, given that the file is opened for writing (w) or \nappending (a).\nThe example below creates a new file called \"testfile.txt\". The file will be \ncreated in the same directory where the PHP code resides:\nExample\n$myfile = fopen(\"testfile.txt\", \"w\")\nPHP File Permissions\nIf you are having errors when trying to get this code to run, check that you have granted your PHP file access to write \ninformation to the hard drive.\nPHP Write to File - fwrite()\nThe\nfwrite()\nfunction is used to write to a file.\nThe first parameter of\nfwrite()\ncontains the name of the file to write to and \nthe second parameter is the string to be written.\nThe example below writes a couple of names into a new file called \"newfile.txt\":\nExample\n<?php\n$myfile = fopen(\"newfile.txt\", \"w\") or die(\"Unable to open file!\");\n$txt = \"John Doe\\n\";\nfwrite($myfile, $txt);\n$txt = \"Jane Doe\\n\";\nfwrite($myfile, $txt);\nfclose($myfile);\n?>\nNotice that we wrote to the file \"newfile.txt\" twice. Each time we wrote to \nthe file we sent the string $txt that first contained \"John Doe\" and second \ncontained \"Jane Doe\". After we finished writing, we closed the file using the\nfclose()\nfunction.\nIf we open the \"newfile.txt\" file it would look like this:\nJohn Doe\nJane Doe\nPHP Overwriting\nNow that \"newfile.txt\" contains some data we can show what happens when we \nopen an existing file for writing. All the existing data will be ERASED and we \nstart with an empty file.\nIn the example below we open our existing file \"newfile.txt\", and write some \nnew data into it:\nExample\n<?php\n$myfile = fopen(\"newfile.txt\", \"w\") or die(\"Unable to open file!\");\n$txt = \"Mickey Mouse\\n\";\nfwrite($myfile, $txt);\n$txt = \"Minnie Mouse\\n\";\nfwrite($myfile, $txt);\nfclose($myfile);\n?>\nIf we now open the \"newfile.txt\" file, both John and Jane have \nvanished, and only the data we just wrote is present:\nMickey Mouse\nMinnie Mouse\nPHP Append Text\nYou can append data to a file by using the \"a\" mode. The \"a\" mode appends \ntext to the end of the file, while the \"w\" mode overrides (and erases) the old \ncontent of the file.\nIn the example below we open our existing file \"newfile.txt\", and \nappend some text to it:\nExample\n<?php\n$myfile = fopen(\"newfile.txt\", \"a\") or die(\"Unable to open file!\");\n$txt = \"Donald \n  Duck\\n\";\nfwrite($myfile, $txt);\n$txt = \"Goofy Goof\\n\";\nfwrite($myfile, $txt);\nfclose($myfile);\n?>\nIf we now open the \"newfile.txt\" file, we will see that Donald Duck \nand Goofy Goof is appended to the end of the file:\nMickey Mouse\nMinnie Mouse\nDonald Duck\nGoofy Goof\nComplete PHP Filesystem Reference\nFor a complete reference of filesystem functions, go to our complete\nPHP Filesystem Reference\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
