      "content": "PHP Error Introduction\nThe error functions are used to deal with error handling and logging.\nThe error functions allow us to define own error handling rules, and modify \nthe way the errors can be logged.\nThe logging functions allow us to send messages \ndirectly to other machines, emails, or system logs.\nThe error reporting functions allow us to customize what level and kind of \nerror feedback is given.\nInstallation\nThe PHP error functions are part of the PHP core. No installation is required \nto use these functions.\nRuntime Configuration\nThe behavior of the error functions is affected by settings in php.ini.\nErrors and logging configuration options:\nName\nDefault\nDescription\nChangeable\nerror_reporting\nNULL\nSets the error reporting level (either an integer or\u00a0 named constants)\nPHP_INI_ALL\ndisplay_errors\n\"1\"\nSpecifies whether errors should be printed to the screen, or if they should be hidden from the user.\nNote:\nThis feature should never be used on production systems (only to support your development)\nPHP_INI_ALL\ndisplay_startup_errors\n\"0\"\nEven when display_errors is on, errors that occur during PHP's startup sequence are not displayed\nNote:\nIt is strongly recommended to keep display_startup_errors off, except for debugging\nPHP_INI_ALL\nlog_errors\n\"0\"\nDefines whether script error messages should be logged to the server's error log or error_log.\nNote:\nIt is strongly advised to use error logging instead of error displaying on production web sites\nPHP_INI_ALL\nlog_errors_max_len\n\"1024\"\nSets the maximum length of log_errors in bytes. The value \"0\" can be used to not apply any maximum length at all. This length is applied to logged errors, displayed errors, and also to $php_errormsg (available since PHP 4.3)\nPHP_INI_ALL\nignore_repeated_errors\n\"0\"\nSpecifies whether to log repeated error messages. When set to \"1\" it will not log errors with repeated errors from the same file on the same line (available since PHP 4.3)\nPHP_INI_ALL\nignore_repeated_source\n\"0\"\nSpecifies whether to log repeated error messages. When set to \"1\" it will not log errors with repeated errors from different files or source lines (available since PHP 4.3)\nPHP_INI_ALL\nreport_memleaks\n\"1\"\nIf set to \"1\" (the default), this parameter will show a report of memory leaks detected by the Zend memory manager (available since PHP 4.3)\nPHP_INI_ALL\ntrack_errors\n\"0\"\nIf set to \"1\", the last error message will always be present in the variable $php_errormsg\nPHP_INI_ALL\nhtml_errors\n\"1\"\nTurns off HTML tags in error messages\nPHP_INI_ALL\nPHP_INI_SYSTEM in PHP <= 4.2.3.\nxmlrpc_errors\n\"0\"\nTurns off normal error reporting and formats errors as XML-RPC error message (available since PHP 4.1)\nPHP_INI_SYSTEM\nxmlrpc_error_number\n\"0\"\nUsed as the value of the XML-RPC faultCode element (available since PHP 4.1)\nPHP_INI_ALL\ndocref_root\n\"\"\n(available since PHP 4.3)\nPHP_INI_ALL\ndocref_ext\n\"\"\n(available since PHP 4.3.2)\nPHP_INI_ALL\nerror_prepend_string\nNULL\nSpecifies a string to output before an error message\nPHP_INI_ALL\nerror_append_string\nNULL\nSpecifies a string to output after an error message\nPHP_INI_ALL\nerror_log\nNULL\nSpecifies the name of the file where script errors should be logged. The file should be writable by the web server's user. If the special value syslog is used, the errors are sent to the system logger instead\nPHP_INI_ALL\nPHP Error and Logging Functions\nFunction\nDescription\ndebug_backtrace()\nGenerates a backtrace\ndebug_print_backtrace()\nPrints a backtrace\nerror_clear_last()\nClears the last error\nerror_get_last()\nReturns the last error that occurred\nerror_log()\nSends an error message to a log, \nto a file, or to a mail account\nerror_reporting()\nSpecifies which errors are reported\nrestore_error_handler()\nRestores the \nrestore_exception_handler()\nRestores the \nset_error_handler()\nSets a user-defined error handler function\nset_exception_handler()\nSets a user-defined exception handler function\ntrigger_error()\nCreates a user-level error message\nuser_error()\nAlias of\ntrigger_error()\nPHP Predefined Error and Logging Constants\nValue\nConstant\nDescription\n1\nE_ERROR\nFatal run-time errors. Errors that cannot be recovered from. Execution of the script is halted\n2\nE_WARNING\nRun-time warnings (non-fatal errors). Execution of the script is not halted\n4\nE_PARSE\nCompile-time parse errors. Parse errors should only be generated by the parser\n8\nE_NOTICE\nRun-time notices. The script found something that might be an error, but could also happen when running a script normally\n16\nE_CORE_ERROR\nFatal errors at PHP startup. This is like E_ERROR, except it is generated by the core of PHP\n32\nE_CORE_WARNING\nNon-fatal errors at PHP startup. This is like E_WARNING, except it is generated by the core of PHP\n64\nE_COMPILE_ERROR\nFatal compile-time errors. This is like E_ERROR, except it is generated by the Zend Scripting Engine\n128\nE_COMPILE_WARNING\nNon-fatal compile-time errors. This is like E_WARNING, except it is generated by the Zend Scripting Engine\n256\nE_USER_ERROR\nFatal user-generated error. This is like E_ERROR, except it is generated in PHP code by using the PHP function trigger_error()\n512\nE_USER_WARNING\nNon-fatal user-generated warning. This is like E_WARNING, except it is generated in PHP code by using the PHP function trigger_error()\n1024\nE_USER_NOTICE\nUser-generated notice. This is like E_NOTICE, except it is generated in PHP code by using the PHP function trigger_error()\n2048\nE_STRICT\nEnable to have PHP suggest changes to your code which will ensure the best interoperability and forward compatibility of your code (Since PHP 5 but not included in E_ALL until PHP 5.4)\n4096\nE_RECOVERABLE_ERROR\nCatchable fatal error. Indicates that a probably dangerous error occurred, but did not leave the Engine in an unstable state. If the error is not caught by a user defined handle, the application aborts as it was an E_ERROR (Since PHP 5.2)\n8192\nE_DEPRECATED\nRun-time notices. Enable this to receive warnings about code that will not work in future versions (Since PHP 5.3)\n16384\nE_USER_DEPRECATED\nUser-generated warning message. This is like E_DEPRECATED, except it is generated in PHP code by using the PHP function trigger_error() (Since PHP 5.3)\n32767\nE_ALL\nEnable all PHP errors and warnings (except E_STRICT in versions < 5.4)\n\n\u2605\n+1",
