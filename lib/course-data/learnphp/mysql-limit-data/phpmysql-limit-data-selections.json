      "content": "Limit Data Selections From a MySQL Database\nMySQL provides a LIMIT clause that is used to specify the number of records \nto return.\nThe LIMIT clause makes it easy to code multi page results or pagination with \nSQL, and is very useful on large tables. Returning a large number of records can \nimpact on performance.\nAssume we wish to select all records from 1 - 30 (inclusive) from a table \ncalled \"Orders\". The SQL query would then look like this:\n$sql = \"SELECT * FROM Orders LIMIT 30\";\nWhen the SQL query above is run, it will return the first 30 records.\nWhat if we want to select records 16 - 25 (inclusive)?\nMysql also provides a way to handle this: by using OFFSET.\nThe SQL query below says \"return only 10 records, start on record 16 (OFFSET \n15)\":\n$sql = \"SELECT * FROM Orders LIMIT 10 OFFSET 15\";\nYou could also use a shorter syntax to achieve the same result:\n$sql = \"SELECT * FROM Orders LIMIT 15, 10\";\nNotice that the numbers are reversed when you use a comma.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
