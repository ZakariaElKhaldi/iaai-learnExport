One pattern and a replacement string. Matches of the pattern are replaced with the\nreplacement string.\n2. An array of patterns and a replacement string. Matches any of the patterns are\nreplaced with the replacement string.\n3. An array of patterns and an array of replacement strings. Matches of each pattern\nare replaced with the replacement string at the same position in the replacements\narray. If no item is found at that position the match is replaced with an empty string.\nReplacement strings may contain a backreference in the form \\n or $n where n is the index\nof a group in the pattern. In the returned string, instances of \\n and $n will be replaced with\nthe substring that was matched by the group or, if \\0 or $0 are used, by the whole\nexpression.\nNote:\nFor each input string, the function evaluates the patterns in the order that they are\ngiven. The result of evaluating the first pattern on the string is used as the input string for\nthe second pattern and so on. This can lead to unexpected behaviour.\nSyntax\npreg_replace(\npatterns, replacements, input, limit, count\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\npatterns\nRequired. Contains a regular expression or array of regular expressions\nreplacements\nRequired. A replacement string or an array of replacement strings\ninput\nRequired. The string or array of strings in which replacements are being performed\nlimit\nOptional. Defaults to -1, meaning unlimited. Sets a limit to how many replacements can be done in each string\ncount\nOptional. After the function has executed, this variable will contain a number indicating how many replacements were performed\nTechnical Details\nReturn Value:\nReturns a string or an array of strings resulting from applying the replacements to the input string or strings\nPHP Version:\n4.0.5+\nChangelog:\nPHP 5.1.0 - The count parameter was added\n\n\u2605\n+1",
