UTF-8 has been developed to transfer a Unicode character from \none computer to another.\nSyntax\nutf8_encode(string)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\nstring\nRequired. Specifies the ISO-8859-1 string to encode\nTechnical Details\nReturn Value:\nThe encoded string on success. FALSE on failure\nPHP Version:\n4.0+\n\n\u2605\n+1",
