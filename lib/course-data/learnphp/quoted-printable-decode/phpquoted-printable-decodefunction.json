A text which is entirely US-ASCII may be encoded in \nquoted-printable to ensure the integrity of the data should the message pass \nthrough a character-translating, or line-wrapping gateway.\nSyntax\nquoted_printable_decode(\nstring\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\nstring\nRequired. Specifies the quoted-printable string to be decoded\nTechnical Details\nReturn Value:\nReturns the 8-bit ASCII string\nPHP Version:\n4+\n\n\u2605\n+1",
