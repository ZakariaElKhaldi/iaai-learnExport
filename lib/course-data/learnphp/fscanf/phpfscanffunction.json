      "content": "Definition and Usage\nThe fscanf() function parses the input from an open file according to the specified format.\nNote: Any whitespace in the format string matches any whitespace in the input \nstream. This means that a tab (\\t) in the format string can match a single space \ncharacter in the input stream.\nSyntax\nfscanf(\nfile\n,\nformat\n,\nmixed\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\nfile\nRequired. Specifies the file to check\nformat\nRequired. Specifies the format.\nPossible format values:\n%% - Returns a percent sign\n%b - Binary number\n%c - The character according to the ASCII value\n%d - Signed decimal number\n%e - Scientific notation (e.g. 1.2e+2)\n%u - Unsigned decimal number\n%f - Floating-point number (local settings aware)\n%F - Floating-point number (not local settings aware)\n%o - Octal number\n%s - String\n%x - Hexadecimal number (lowercase letters)\n%X - Hexadecimal number (uppercase letters)\nAdditional format values. These are placed between the % and the letter (example %.2f):\n+ (Forces both + and - in front of numbers. By default, only negative numbers are marked)\n' (Specifies what to use as padding. Default is space. Must be used  together with the width specifier.  Example: %'x20s (this uses \"x\" as padding)\n- (Left-justifies the variable value)\n[0-9] (Specifies the minimum width held of to the variable value)\n.[0-9] (Specifies the number of decimal digits or maximum string length)\nNote:\nIf multiple additional format values are used, they must be in the same order as above.\nmixed\nOptional.\nTechnical Details\nReturn Value:\nThe read string, FALSE on \n failure\nPHP Version:\n4.0.1+\n\n\u2605\n+1",
