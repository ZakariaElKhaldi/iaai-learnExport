      "content": "Variables are \"containers\" for storing information.\nCreating (Declaring) PHP Variables\nIn PHP, a variable starts with the\n$\nsign, followed by the name of the variable:\nExample\n$x = 5;\n$y = \"John\";\n\nIn the example above, the variable\n$x\nwill hold the value\n5\n, and the variable\n$y\nwill hold the value\n\"John\"\n.\nNote:\nWhen you assign a text value to a variable, put quotes around the value.\nNote:\nUnlike other programming languages, PHP has no command \nfor declaring a variable. It is created the moment you first assign a value to \nit.\nThink of variables as containers for storing data.\nPHP Variables\nA variable can have a short name (like\n$x\nand\n$y\n) or a more descriptive name (\n$age\n,\n$carname\n,\n$total_volume\n).\nRules for PHP variables:\nA variable starts with the\n$\nsign, followed by the name of the variable\nA variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character\nA variable name cannot start with a number\nA variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )\nVariable names are case-sensitive (\n$age\nand\n$AGE\nare two different variables)\nRemember that PHP variable names are case-sensitive!\nOutput Variables\nThe PHP\necho\nstatement is often used to output data to the screen.\nThe following example will show how to output text and a variable:\nExample\n$txt = \".com\";\necho \"I love $txt!\";\n\nThe following example will produce the same output as the example above:\nExample\n$txt = \".com\";\necho \"I love \" . $txt . \"!\";\n\nThe following example will output the sum of two variables:\nExample\n$x = 5;\n$y = 4;\necho $x + $y;\n\nNote:\nYou will learn more about the\necho\nstatement and how \nto output data to the screen in the\nPHP Echo/Print chapter\n.\nPHP is a Loosely Typed Language\nIn the example above, notice that we did not have to tell PHP which data type the variable is.\nPHP automatically associates a data type to the variable, depending on its value. \nSince the data types are not set in a strict sense, you can do things like \nadding a string to an integer without causing an error.\nIn PHP 7, type declarations were added. This gives an option to specify \nthe data type expected when declaring a function, and by enabling the strict requirement, it will throw a \"Fatal \nError\" on a type mismatch.\nYou will learn more about\nstrict\nand\nnon-strict\nrequirements, and  \ndata type declarations in the\nPHP Functions\nchapter.\nVariable Types\nPHP has no command for declaring a variable, and the data type depends on the value of the variable.\nExample\n$x = 5;      // $x is an integer\n$y = \"John\"; // $y is a string\necho $x;\necho $y;\n\nPHP supports the following data types:\nString\nInteger\nFloat (floating point numbers - also called double)\nBoolean\nArray\nObject\nNULL\nResource\nGet the Type\nTo get the data type of a variable, use the\nvar_dump()\nfunction.\nExample\nThe\nvar_dump()\nfunction returns the data type and the value:\n$x = 5;\nvar_dump($x);\n\nExample\nSee what\nvar_dump()\nreturns for other data types:\nvar_dump(5);\nvar_dump(\"John\");\nvar_dump(3.14);\nvar_dump(true);\nvar_dump([2, 3, 56]);\nvar_dump(NULL);\n\nAssign String to a Variable\nAssigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:\nExample\n$x = \"John\";\necho $x;\n\nString variables can be declared either by using double or single quotes, but you should\nbe aware of the differences. Learn more about the differences in the\nPHP Strings chapter\n.\nAssign Multiple Values\nYou can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:\nExample\nAll three variables get the value \"Fruit\":\n$x = $y = $z = \"Fruit\";\n\n\u2605\n+1",
