This means that it is \npossible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.\nClassic web pages, (which do not use AJAX) must reload the entire page if the \ncontent should change.\nExamples of applications using AJAX: Google Maps, Gmail, Youtube, and \nFacebook tabs.\nHow AJAX Works\nAJAX is Based on Internet Standards\nAJAX is based on internet standards, and uses a combination of:\nXMLHttpRequest object (to exchange data asynchronously with a server)\nJavaScript/DOM (to display/interact with the information)\nCSS (to style the data)\nXML (often used as the format for transferring data)\nAJAX applications are browser- and platform-independent!\nGoogle Suggest\nAJAX was made popular in 2005 by Google, with Google Suggest.\nGoogle Suggest\nis using AJAX to create a very dynamic web interface: \nWhen you start typing in Google's search box, a JavaScript sends the letters off \nto a server and the server returns a list of suggestions.\nStart Using AJAX Today\nIn our PHP tutorial, we will demonstrate how AJAX can update parts of a web \npage, without reloading the whole page. The server script will be written in PHP.\nIf you want to learn more about AJAX, visit our\nAJAX tutorial\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
