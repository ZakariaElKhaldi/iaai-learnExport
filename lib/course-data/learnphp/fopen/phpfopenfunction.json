Unix systems use \\n, Windows systems use \\r\\n, and Macintosh \nsystems use \\r as the line ending character.\nWindows offers a translation flag ('t') which will translate \\n to \\r\\n when working with the file. \nYou can also use 'b' to force binary mode. To use \nthese flags, specify either 'b' or 't' as the last character of the mode parameter.\nSyntax\nfopen(\nfilename\n,\nmode\n,\ninclude_path\n,\ncontext\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\nfilename\nRequired. Specifies the file or URL to open\nmode\nRequired. Specifies the type of access you require to the file/stream.\nPossible values:\n\"r\" - Read only. Starts at the beginning of the file\n\"r+\" - Read/Write. Starts at the beginning of the file\n\"w\" - Write only. Opens and truncates the file; or creates a new  file if it doesn't exist. \n    Place file pointer at the beginning of the file\n\"w+\" - Read/Write. Opens and truncates the file; or creates a new  file if it doesn't exist. \n    Place file pointer at the beginning of the file\n\"a\" - Write only. Opens and writes to the end of the file or \n    creates a new file if it doesn't exist\n\"a+\" - Read/Write. Preserves file content by writing to the \n    end of the file\n\"x\" - Write only. Creates a new file. Returns FALSE and an \n    error if file already exists\n\"x+\" - Read/Write. Creates a new file. Returns FALSE and an \n    error if file already exists\n\"c\" - Write only. Opens the file; or creates a new  file if it doesn't exist. \n    Place file pointer at the beginning of the file\n\"c+\" - Read/Write. Opens the file; or creates a new  file if it doesn't exist. \n    Place file pointer at the beginning of the file\n\"e\" - Only available in PHP compiled on POSIX.1-2008 conform systems.\ninclude_path\nOptional. Set this parameter to '1' if you want to search for the file in the include_path (in php.ini) as well\ncontext\nOptional. Specifies the context of the file handle. Context is a set of options that can modify the behavior of a stream\nTechnical Details\nReturn Value:\nA file pointer resource on success, FALSE and an error on failure. You can \n hide the error by adding an \"@\" in front of the function name.\nPHP Version:\n4.3+\nPHP Changelog:\nPHP \n  7.1: Added \"e\" option\nPHP \n  5.2: Added \"c\" and \"c+\" options\n\n\u2605\n+1",
