Testing!\");\nfclose($file);\n}\n?>\nDefinition and Usage\nThe set_file_buffer() function specifies the number of bytes to buffer on the \ngiven file.\nOutput using fwrite() is normally buffered at 8K. So, if two processes \nwrites to the same file, each will write up to 8K \nbefore pausing, and allow the other to write. If buffer is 0, write operations are unbuffered \n(meaning that the first write process will be completed before allowing other \nprocesses to write).\nTip:\nThis function is an alias of stream_set_write_buffer().\nSyntax\nset_file_buffer(\nfile\n,\nbuffer\n)\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\nfile\nRequired. Specifies a file pointer\nbuffer\nRequired. Specifies the number of bytes to buffer\nTechnical Details\nReturn Value:\n0 on success, another value if request failed\nPHP Version:\n4.3+\n\n\u2605\n+1",
