It looks a lot like HTML, except \nthat you make up your own tags.\nIf you want to learn more about XML, please visit our\nXML tutorial\n.\nWhat is an XML Parser?\nTo read and update, create and manipulate an XML document, you will need \nan XML parser.\nIn PHP there are two major types of XML parsers:\nTree-Based Parsers\nEvent-Based Parsers\nTree-Based Parsers\nTree-based parsers holds the entire document in Memory and transforms the XML document into a \nTree structure. It analyzes the whole document, and provides access to the Tree elements (DOM).\nThis type of parser is a better option for smaller \nXML documents, but not for large XML document as it causes major \nperformance issues.\nExample of tree-based parsers:\nSimpleXML\nDOM\nEvent-Based Parsers\nEvent-based parsers do \nnot hold the entire document in Memory, instead, they read in one node at a \ntime and allow you to interact with in real time. Once you move onto the \nnode, the old one is thrown away.\nThis type of parser is well suited for large XML documents. It parses faster and consumes less memory.\nExample of event-based parsers:\nXMLReader\nXML Expat Parser\n\n\u2605\n+1",
