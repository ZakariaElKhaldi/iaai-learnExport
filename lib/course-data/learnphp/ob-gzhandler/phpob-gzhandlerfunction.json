It compresses the\ncontents of the output buffer using a compression algorithm that is supported by the\nbrowser and returns the compressed content. It also sends an HTTP header indicating\nwhich compression algorithm was used.\nSyntax\nWhen used as a callback for\nob_start()\n:\nob_start(\"ob_gzhandler\");\nWhen used on its own:\nob_gzhandler(buffer, phase);\nParameter Values\nParameter\nDescription\nbuffer\nThe contents of the output buffer\nphase\nA bitmask which may have any number of the following flags:\nPHP_OUTPUT_HANDLER_START - If the output buffer was\njust created\nPHP_OUTPUT_HANDLER_FLUSH - If the output buffer is\ncurrently being flushed\nPHP_OUTPUT_HANDLER_FINAL - If the output buffer will be\ndeleted right after this operation\nTechnical Details\nReturn Value:\nReturns a string containing the compressed contents\nPHP Version:\n4.0.4+\n\n\u2605\n+1",
