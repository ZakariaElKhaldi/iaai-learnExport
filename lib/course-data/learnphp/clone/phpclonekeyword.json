Objects are always passed by reference, so if the original object has\nanother object in its properties, the copy will point to the same object. This behavior can be\nchanged by creating a\n__clone()\nmethod in the class.\nRelated Pages\nRead more about classes in our\nPHP Classes and Objects Tutorial\n.\nMore Examples\nExample\nCreate a copy of an object which has a reference:\n<?php\nclass MyClass {\npublic $amount;\n}\n// Create an object with a \n  reference\n$value = 5;\n$obj = new MyClass();\n$obj->amount = &$value;\n// Clone the object\n$copy = clone $obj;\n// Change the value in the \n  original object\n$obj->amount = 6;\n// The copy is changed\nprint_r($copy);\n?>\n\nExample\nUse a\n__clone()\nmethod to break references in a copied object:\n<?php\nclass MyClass {\npublic $amount;\npublic function __clone() {\n$value = $this->amount;\nunset($this->amount); // Unset breaks references\n$this->amount = $value;\n}\n}\n// Create an object with a reference\n$value = 5;\n$obj = new MyClass();\n$obj->amount = &$value;\n// Clone \n  the object\n$copy = clone $obj;\n// Change the value in the original \n  object\n$obj->amount = 6;\n// The copy is not changed\nprint_r($copy);\n?>\n\n\u2605\n+1",
