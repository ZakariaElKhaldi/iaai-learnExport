It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.\nIn JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any information! So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.\nTypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.\nFor example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not.\nTypeScript uses compile time type checking. Which means it checks if the specified types match\nbefore\nrunning the code, not\nwhile\nrunning the code.\nHow do I use TypeScript?\nA common way to use TypeScript is to use the official TypeScript compiler, which transpiles TypeScript code into JavaScript.\nThe \nSome popular code editors, such as Visual Studio Code, have built-in TypeScript support and can show errors as you write code!\nTypeScript Exercises\nTest Yourself With Exercises\nExercise:\nComplete the sentence:\nTypeScript allows developers to add\n.\nSubmit Answer \u00bb\nStart the Exercise\n\n\u2605\n+1",
