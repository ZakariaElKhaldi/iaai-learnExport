      "content": "Introduction\nThe\n TypeScript Tutorial\nis comprehensive and beginner-friendly.\nIt will give you a fundamental knowledge of TypeScript.\nIt is designed for beginners and requires only basic JavaScript knowledge.\nThe content has been carefully made to be bite-sized, simple, and easy to understand.\nThe content has been proven by millions of users over the years. It is updated and improved frequently.\nThe syllabus outline and its sequence are structured so you can learn TypeScript step by step, from the introduction to advanced features.\nGet Started With TypeScript \u00bb\nLearning Outcomes\nLearn what TypeScript is and how to get started\nWork with simple types (string, number, boolean)\nUse special types (any, void, never, undefined, null)\nCreate and work with arrays and tuples\nDefine object types and enums\nUse type aliases and interfaces\nWork with union types and functions\nUnderstand type casting and classes\nUse basic generics and utility types\nNote:\nAre you a teacher teaching TypeScript?\n Academy\nis a toolbox of features that can help you teach. It offers classroom features such as pre-built study plans, classroom administration and much more. Read more about\nAcademy here\n.\nWhich Subjects Are TypeScript Relevant For?\nWeb Development:\nTypeScript enhances JavaScript development with static typing.\nFront-end Development:\nTypeScript is widely used in Angular and other frameworks.\nBack-end Development:\nTypeScript can be used with Node.js for server-side code.\nApplication Development:\nTypeScript supports building large-scale applications.\nEnterprise Software:\nTypeScript provides better tooling and maintainability.\nAPI Development:\nTypeScript offers strong typing for API contracts.\nFull-stack Development:\nTypeScript enables type safety across the stack.\nGet Started\nActivities\nIn this tutorial we offer different activities for you to learn TypeScript for free:\nLessons\nExercises\nQuizzes\nSign in to Track Progress\nYou can also create a free account to \nAs a signed-in user, you get access to features such as:\nLearning paths\nSandbox and lab environments\nAchievements\nAnd much more!\n\nOverview of the Modules\nTS HOME\nTS Introduction\nTS Get Started\nTS Simple Types\nTS Special Types\nTS Arrays\nTS Tuples\nTS Object Types\nTS Enums\nTS Aliases & Interfaces\nTS Union Types\nTS Functions\nTS Casting\nTS Classes\nTS Basic Generics\nTS Utility Types\nTS Keyof\nTS Null\nTS Definitely Typed\nTS 5 Updates\nGet Started\nSandbox and Lab Environment\nTypeScript, like any programming language, is best learned through hands-on practice.\nTry this example using our editor:\nExample\nconsole.log('Hello World!');\n\nIf you want to explore more and host your project, we have a feature called\nSpaces\nthat allows you to build, test and run TypeScript applications for free.\nHere you get a secure sandbox environment called Spaces, where you can practice TypeScript code and test projects in real-time.\nSpaces allow you to test, build, and deploy code. This includes a  subdomain, hosting, and secure SSL certificates.\nSpaces require no installation and run directly in the browser.\nFeatures include:\nCollaboration\nFile navigator\nTerminal & log\nPackage manager\nDatabase\nEnvironment manager\nAnalytics\nCreate a Spaces Account\nTypeScript Certification\n offers an end-of-pathway certification program.\nHere you can take exams to get certified.\nThe TypeScript exam is a test that summarizes the  TypeScript syllabus.\nAfter passing the exam you get the \"Certified TypeScript Developer\" Certification.\nThere are two different types of certifications:\nNon-adaptive\nAdaptive\nThe non-adaptive is pass or no pass.\nThe adaptive certification exam is adaptive and graded; students will get a grade from intermediate, advanced to professional.\nBuy Certificate \u00bb\nAre You a Teacher?\nAre you interested in learning how you can use\n Academy\nto Teach \nTypeScript?\nWatch a demo of\n Academy\n. You'll see how it works, and discover how it can make teaching programming easier and more engaging.\nWatch Demo \u00bb\n\n\u2605\n+1",
