The way they are linked together is that each node points to where in the memory the \nLinked Lists\nA linked list consists of nodes with some sort of data, and a pointer, or link, to the \nA big benefit with using linked lists is that nodes are stored wherever there is free space in memory, the nodes do not have to be stored contiguously right after each other like elements are stored in arrays. Another nice thing with linked lists is that when adding or removing nodes, the rest of the nodes in the list do not have to be shifted.\nLinked Lists vs Arrays\nThe easiest way to understand linked lists is perhaps by comparing linked lists with arrays.\nLinked lists consist of nodes, and is a linear data structure we make ourselves, unlike arrays which is an existing data structure in the programming language that we can use.\nNodes in a linked list store links to other nodes, but array elements do not need to store links to other elements.\nNote:\nHow linked lists and arrays are stored in memory will be explained in more detail on\nthe \n.\nThe table below compares linked lists with arrays to give a better understanding of what linked lists are.\nArrays\nLinked Lists\nAn existing data structure in the programming language\nYes\nNo\nFixed size in memory\nYes\nNo\nElements, or nodes, are stored right after each other in memory (contiguously)\nYes\nNo\nMemory usage is low\n(each node only contains data, no links to other nodes)\nYes\nNo\nElements, or nodes, can be accessed directly (random access)\nYes\nNo\nElements, or nodes, can be inserted or deleted in constant time, no shifting operations in memory needed.\nNo\nYes\nTo explain these differences in more detail, the \nDSA Exercises\nTest Yourself With Exercises\nExercise:\nWhat is a node in a Linked List?\nEach node in a Linked List \ncontains\n, and a\nto where the \nis placed in memory.\nSubmit Answer \u00bb\nStart the Exercise\n\n\u2605\n+1",
