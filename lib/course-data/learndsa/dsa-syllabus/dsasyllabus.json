It is updated and improved frequently.\nThe syllabus outline and its sequence are structured so you can learn DSA step by step, from basic data structures to advanced algorithms.\nGet Started With DSA \u00bb\nLearning Outcomes\nUnderstand basic data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs.\nLearn how to sort and search data efficiently.\nAnalyze the performance of algorithms using time complexity.\nImprove program efficiency by selecting appropriate data structures.\nSolve real-world problems with effective algorithms.\nNote:\nAre you a teacher teaching DSA?\n Academy\nis a toolbox of features that can help you teach. It offers classroom features such as pre-built study plans, classroom administration and much more. Read more about\nAcademy here\n.\nWhich Subjects Are DSA Relevant For?\nSoftware Development:\nDSA is essential for efficient programming.\nProblem Solving:\nDSA provides tools for solving complex problems.\nSystem Design:\nDSA helps in designing scalable systems.\nCompetitive Programming:\nDSA is crucial for coding competitions.\nTechnical Interviews:\nDSA is a key topic in job interviews.\nPerformance Optimization:\nDSA enables writing efficient code.\nData Science:\nDSA helps in handling large datasets efficiently.\nGet Started\nActivities\nIn this tutorial we offer different activities for you to learn DSA for free:\nLessons\nExercises\nQuizzes\nSign in to Track Progress\nYou can also create a free account to \nAs a signed-in user, you get access to features such as:\nLearning paths\nSandbox and lab environments\nAchievements\nAnd much more!\n\nOverview of the Modules\nDSA HOME\nDSA Intro\nDSA Simple Algorithm\nDSA Arrays\nDSA Bubble Sort\nDSA Selection Sort\nDSA Insertion Sort\nDSA Quick Sort\nDSA Counting Sort\nDSA Radix Sort\nDSA Merge Sort\nDSA Linear Search\nDSA Binary Search\nDSA Linked Lists\nDSA Linked Lists in Memory\nDSA Linked Lists Types\nLinked Lists Operations\nDSA Stacks\nDSA Queues\nDSA Hash Tables\nDSA Hash Sets\nDSA Hash Maps\nDSA Trees\nDSA Binary Trees\nDSA Pre-order Traversal\nDSA In-order Traversal\nDSA Post-order Traversal\nDSA Array Implementation\nDSA Binary Search Trees\nDSA AVL Trees\nDSA Graphs\nGraphs Implementation\nDSA Graphs Traversal\nDSA Cycle Detection\nDSA Shortest Path\nDSA Dijkstra's\nDSA Bellman-Ford\nMinimum Spanning Tree\nDSA Prim's\nDSA Kruskal's\nDSA Maximum Flow\nDSA Ford-Fulkerson\nDSA Edmonds-Karp\nDSA Time Complexity\nDSA Bubble Sort Time Complexity\nDSA Selection Sort Time Complexity\nDSA Insertion Sort Time Complexity\nDSA Time Complexity for Specific Algorithms\nDSA Counting Sort Time Complexity\nDSA Radix Sort Time Complexity\nDSA Merge Sort Time Complexity\nDSA Linear Search Time Complexity\nDSA Binary Search Time Complexity\nGet Started\nSandbox and Lab Environment\nDSA, like any programming topic, is best learned through hands-on practice.\nTry this example using our editor:\nExample\nmy_array = [7, 12, 9, 4, 11]\nminVal = my_array[0]\n\nfor i in my_array:\n    if i < minVal:\n        minVal = i\n\nprint('Lowest value:',minVal)\nRun Example \u00bb\nIf you want to explore more and host your project, we have a feature called\nSpaces\nthat allows you to practice DSA implementations for free.\nHere you get a secure sandbox environment called Spaces, where you can practice algorithms and test data structures in real-time.\nSpaces allow you to test, implement, and analyze code. This includes a  subdomain, hosting, and secure SSL certificates.\nSpaces require no installation and run directly in the browser.\nFeatures include:\nCollaboration\nFile navigator\nTerminal & log\nPackage manager\nDatabase\nEnvironment manager\nAnalytics\nCreate a Spaces Account\nDSA Certification\n offers an end-of-pathway certification program.\nHere you can take exams to get certified.\nThe DSA exam is a test that summarizes the  DSA syllabus.\nAfter passing the exam you get the \"Certified DSA Developer\" Certification.\nThere are two different types of certifications:\nNon-adaptive\nAdaptive\nThe non-adaptive is pass or no pass.\nThe adaptive certification is adaptive and graded; students will get a grade from intermediate, advanced to professional.\nBuy Certificate \u00bb\nAre You a Teacher?\nAre you interested in learning how you can use\n Academy\nto Teach \nDSA?\nWatch a demo of\n Academy\n. You'll see how it works, and discover how it can make teaching programming easier and more engaging.\nWatch Demo \u00bb\n\n\u2605\n+1",
