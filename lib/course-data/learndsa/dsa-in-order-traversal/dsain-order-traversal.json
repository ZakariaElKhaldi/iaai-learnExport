      "content": "In-order Traversal of Binary Trees\nIn-order Traversal is a type of Depth First Search, where each node is visited in a certain order. Read more about Binary Tree traversals in general\nhere\n.\nRun the animation below to see how an In-order Traversal of a Binary Tree is done.\nR\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nResult:\nIn-order Traverse\nIn-order Traversal does a recursive In-order Traversal of the left subtree, visits the root node, and finally, does a recursive In-order Traversal of the right subtree. This traversal is mainly used for Binary Search Trees where it returns values in ascending order.\nWhat makes this traversal \"in\" order, is that the node is visited in between the recursive function calls. The node is visited after the In-order Traversal of the left subtree, and before the In-order Traversal of the right subtree.\nThis is how the code for In-order Traversal looks like:\nExample\nPython:\ndef inOrderTraversal(node):\n    if node is None:\n        return\n    inOrderTraversal(node.left)\n    print(node.data, end=\", \")\n    inOrderTraversal(node.right)\nRun Example \u00bb\nThe\ninOrderTraversal()\nfunction keeps calling itself with the current left child node as an argument (line 4) until that argument is\nNone\nand the function returns (line 2-3).\nThe first time the argument\nnode\nis\nNone\nis when the left child of node C is given as an argument (C has no left child).\nAfter that, the\ndata\npart of node C is printed (line 5), which means that 'C' is the first thing that gets printed.\nThen, node C's right child is given as an argument (line 6), which is\nNone\n, so the function call returns without doing anything else.\nAfter 'C' is printed, the \ninOrderTraversal()\nfunction calls continue to run, so that 'A' gets printed, then 'D', then 'R', and so on.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
