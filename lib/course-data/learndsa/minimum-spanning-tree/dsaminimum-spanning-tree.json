      "content": "The Minimum Spanning Tree Problem\nThe Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is the collection of edges required to connect all vertices in an undirected graph, with the minimum total edge weight.\n{{ buttonText }}\n{{ msgDone }}\nThe animation above runs\nPrim's algorithm\nto find the MST. Another way to find the MST, which also works for unconnected graphs, is to run\nKruskal's algorithm\n.\nIt is called a Minimum Spanning\nTree\n, because it is a connected, acyclic, undirected graph, which is the definition of a tree data structure.\nIn the real world, finding the Minimum Spanning Tree can help us find the most effective way to connect houses to the internet or to the electrical grid, or it can help us finding the fastest route to deliver packages.\nAn MST Thought Experiment\nLet's imagine that the circles in the animation above are villages that are without electrical power, and you want to connect them to the electrical grid. After one village is given electrical power, the electrical cables must be spread out from that village to the others. The villages can be connected in a lot of different ways, each route having a different cost.\nThe electrical cables are expensive, and digging ditches for the cables, or stretching the cables in the air is expensive as well. The terrain can certainly be a challenge, and then there is perhaps a future cost for maintenance that is different depending on where the cables end up.\nAll these route costs can be factored in as edge weights in a graph. Every vertex represents a village, and every edge represents a possible route for the electrical cable between two villages.\nAfter such a graph is created, the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) can be found, and that will be the most effective way to connect these villages to the electrical grid.\nAnd this is actually what the first MST algorithm (Bor\u016fvka's algorithm) was made for in 1926: To find the best way to connect the historical region of Moravia, in the Check Republic, to the electrical grid.\nMST Algorithms\nThe \nPrim's algorithm\n, and\nKruskal's algorithm\n.\nPrim's algorithm\nKruskal's algorithm\nCan it find MSTs (a Minimum Spanning Forest) in an unconnected graph?\nNo\nYes\nHow does it start?\nThe MST grows from a randomly chosen vertex.\nThe first edge in the MST is the edge with lowest edge weight.\nWhat time complexity does it have?\n\\(O(V^2)\\), or \\( O( E \\cdot \\log{V}) \\) (Optimized)\n\\( O( E \\cdot \\log{E} ) \\)\n\n\u2605\n+1",
