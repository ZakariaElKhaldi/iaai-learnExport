      "content": "Data Structures\nis about how data can be stored in different structures.\nAlgorithms\nis about how to solve different problems, often by searching through and manipulating data structures.\nTheory about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) helps us to use large amounts of data to solve problems efficiently.\nWhat are Data Structures?\nA data structure is a way to store data.\nWe structure data in different ways depending on what data we have, and what we want to do with it.\nFamily tree\nFirst, let's consider an example without computers in mind, just to get the idea.\nIf we want to store data about people we are related to, we use a family tree as the data structure. We choose a family tree as the data structure because we have information about people we are related to and how they are related, and we want an overview so that we can easily find a specific family member, several generations back.\nWith such a family tree data structure visually in front of you, it is easy to see, for example, who my mother's mother is\u2014it is 'Emma,' right? But without the links from child to parents that this data structure provides, it would be difficult to determine how the individuals are related.\nData structures give us the possibility to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services.\nData structures are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms. They help in managing and organizing data, reduce complexity, and increase efficiency.\nIn Computer Science there are two different kinds of data structures.\nPrimitive Data Structures\nare basic data structures provided by programming languages to represent single values, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.\nAbstract Data Structures\nare higher-level data structures that are built using primitive data types and provide more complex and specialized operations. Some common examples of abstract data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.\nWhat are Algorithms?\nAn algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem or achieve a specific goal.\nPommes Frites Recipe\nA cooking recipe written on a piece of paper is an example of an algorithm, where the goal is to make a certain dinner. The steps needed to make a specific dinner are described exactly.\nWhen we talk about algorithms in Computer Science, the step-by-step instructions are written in a programming language, and instead of food ingredients, an algorithm uses data structures.\nAlgorithms are fundamental to computer programming as they provide step-by-step instructions for executing tasks. An efficient algorithm can help us to find the solution we are looking for, and to transform a slow program into a faster one.\nBy studying algorithms, developers can write better programs.\nAlgorithm examples:\nFinding the fastest route in a GPS navigation system\nNavigating an airplane or a car (cruise control)\nFinding what users search for (search engine)\nSorting, for example sorting movies by rating\nThe algorithms we will look at in this tutorial are designed to solve specific problems, and are often made to work on specific data structures. For example, the 'Bubble Sort' algorithm is designed to sort values, and is made to work on arrays.\nData Structures together with Algorithms\nData structures and algorithms (DSA) go hand in hand. A data structure is not worth much if you cannot search through it or manipulate it efficiently using algorithms, and the algorithms in this tutorial are not worth much without a data structure to work on.\nDSA is about finding efficient ways to store and retrieve data, to perform operations on data, and to solve specific problems.\nBy understanding DSA, you can:\nDecide which data structure or algorithm is best for a given situation.\nMake programs that run faster or use less memory.\nUnderstand how to approach complex problems and solve them in a systematic way.\nWhere is Data Structures and Algorithms Needed?\nData Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are used in virtually every software system, from operating systems to web applications:\nFor managing large amounts of data, such as in a social network or a search engine.\nFor scheduling tasks, to decide which task a computer should do first.\nFor planning routes, like in a GPS system to find the shortest path from A to B.\nFor optimizing processes, such as arranging tasks so they can be completed as quickly as possible.\nFor solving complex problems: From finding the best way to pack a truck to making a computer 'learn' from data.\nDSA is fundamental in nearly every part of the software world:\nOperating Systems\nDatabase Systems\nWeb Applications\nMachine Learning\nVideo Games\nCryptographic Systems\nData Analysis\nSearch Engines\nTheory and Terminology\nAs we go along in this tutorial, new theoretical concepts and terminology (new words) will be needed so that we can better understand the data structures and algorithms we will be working on.\nThese new words and concepts will be introduced and explained properly when they are needed, but here is a list of some key terms, just to get an overview of what is coming:\nTerm\nDescription\nAlgorithm\nA set of step-by-step instructions to solve a specific problem.\nData Structure\nA way of organizing data so it can be used efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, and binary trees.\nTime Complexity\nA measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.\nSpace Complexity\nA measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.\nBig O Notation\nA mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Used in this tutorial to describe the time complexity of an algorithm.\nRecursion\nA programming technique where a function calls itself.\nDivide and Conquer\nA method of solving complex problems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, solving the sub-problems, and combining the solutions. Recursion is often used when using this method in an algorithm.\nBrute Force\nA simple and straight forward way an algorithm can work by simply trying all possible solutions and then choosing the best one.\nWhere to Start?\nIn this tutorial, you will first learn about a data structure with matching algorithms, before moving on to the \nFurther into the tutorial the concepts become more complex, and it is therefore a good idea to learn DSA by doing the tutorial step-by-step from the start.\nAnd as mentioned on the \nJavaScript\n,\nC\nor\nPython\n, before doing this tutorial.\nOn the \nClick the '\n\n\u2605\n+1",
