      "content": "Arrays\nAn array is a data structure used to store multiple elements.\nArrays are used by many algorithms.\nFor example, an algorithm can be used to look through an array to find the lowest value, like the animation below shows:\nSpeed:\n{{ buttonText }}\n{{ msgDone }}\nLowest value: {{ minVal }}\nIn Python, an array can be created like this:\nmy_array = [7, 12, 9, 4, 11]\nNote:\nThe Python code above actually generates a Python 'list' data type, but for the scope of this tutorial the 'list' data type can be used in the same way as an array. Learn more about Python lists\nhere\n.\nArrays are indexed, meaning that each element in the array has an index, a number that says where in the array the element is located. The programming languages in this tutorial (Python, Java, and C) use zero-based indexing for arrays, meaning that the first element in an array can be accessed at index 0.\nIn Python, this code use index 0 to write the first array element (value 7) to the console:\nExample\nPython:\nmy_array = [7, 12, 9, 4, 11]\nprint( my_array[0] )\nRun Example \u00bb\nAlgorithm: Find The Lowest Value in an Array\nLet's create our first algorithm using the array data structure.\nBelow is the algorithm to find the lowest number in an array.\nHow it works:\nGo through the values in the array one by one.\nCheck if the current value is the lowest so far, and if it is, store it.\nAfter looking at all the values, the stored value will be the lowest of all values in the array.\nTry the simulation below to see how the algorithm for finding the lowest value works (the animation is the same as the one on the top of this page):\nSpeed:\n{{ buttonText }}\n{{ msgDone }}\nLowest value: {{ minVal }}\nThis \n{{ buttonText }}\n{{ msgDone }}\n[\n{{ x.dieNmbr }}\n]\nImplementation\nBefore implementing the algorithm using an actual programming language, it is usually smart to first write the algorithm as a step-by-step procedure.\nIf you can write down the algorithm in something between human language and programming language, the algorithm will be easier to implement later because we avoid drowning in all the details of the programming language syntax.\nCreate a variable 'minVal' and set it equal to the first value of the array.\nGo through every element in the array.\nIf the current element has a lower value than 'minVal', update 'minVal' to this value.\nAfter looking at all the elements in the array, the 'minVal' variable now contains the lowest value.\nYou can also write the algorithm in a way that looks more like a programming language if you want to, like this:\nVariable 'minVal' = array[0]\nFor each element in the array\nIf current element < minVal\nminVal = current element\nNote:\nThe two step-by-step descriptions of the algorithm we have written above can be called 'pseudocode'. Pseudocode is a description of what a program does, using language that is something between human language and a programming language.\nAfter we have written down the algorithm, it is much easier to implement the algorithm in a specific programming language:\nExample\nPython:\nmy_array = [7, 12, 9, 4, 11]\nminVal = my_array[0]    # Step 1\n\nfor i in my_array:      # Step 2\n    if i < minVal:      # Step 3\n        minVal = i\n\nprint('Lowest value: ',minVal) # Step 4\nRun Example \u00bb\nAlgorithm Time Complexity\nWhen exploring algorithms, we often look at how much time an algorithm takes to run relative to the size of the data set.\nIn the example above, the time the algorithm needs to run is proportional, or linear, to the size of the data set. This is because the algorithm must visit every array element one time to find the lowest value. The loop must run 5 times since there are 5 values in the array. And if the array had 1000 values, the loop would have to run 1000 times.\nTry the simulation below to see this relationship between the number of compare operations needed to find the lowest value, and the size of the array.\nSee\nthis page\nfor a more thorough explanation of what time complexity is.\nEach algorithm in this tutorial will be presented together with its time complexity.\nSet values:\n{{ this.userX }}\nRandom\nDescending\nAscending\n10 Random\nOperations: {{ operations }}\n{{runBtnText}}\nClear\nDSA Exercises\nTest Yourself With Exercises\nExercise:\nHow can we print value \"7\" from the array below?\nmy_array = [7, 12, 9, 4, 11]\nprint(my_array[\n])\nSubmit Answer \u00bb\nStart the Exercise\n\n\u2605\n+1",
