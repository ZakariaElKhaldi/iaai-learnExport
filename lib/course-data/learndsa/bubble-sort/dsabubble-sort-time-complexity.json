And for a very big number \\(n\\), the term \\(\\frac{n^2}{2}\\) becomes a lot bigger than the term \\(\\frac{n}{2}\\). So large in fact, that we can approximate by simply removing that second term \\(\\frac{n}{2}\\).\n\\[Operations = \\frac{n^2}{2} - \\frac{n}{2} \\approx \\frac{n^2}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot n^2 \\]\nWhen we are looking at time complexity like we are here, using Big O notation, factors are disregarded, so factor \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) is omitted. This means that the run time for the Bubble Sort algorithm can be described with time complexity, using Big O notation like this:\n\\[ O( \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot n^2) = \\underline{\\underline{O(n^2)}} \\]\nAnd the graph describing the Bubble Sort time complexity looks like this:\nAs you can see, the run time increases really fast when the size of the array is increased.\nLuckily there are sorting algorithms that are faster than this, like\nQuicksort\n.\nBubble Sort Simulation\nChoose the number of values in an array, and run this simulation to see how the number of operations Bubble Sort needs on an array of \\(n\\) elements is \\(O(n^2)\\):\nSet values:\n{{ this.userX }}\nRandom\nWorst Case\nBest Case\n10 Random\nOperations: {{ operations }}\n{{runBtnText}}\nClear\nThe red line above represents the upper bound time complexity \\(O(n^2)\\), and the actual function in this case is \\(1.05 \\cdot n^2\\).\nA function \\(f(n)\\) is said to be \\(O(g(n))\\) if we have a positive constant \\(C\\) so that \\(C \\cdot g(n)>f(n)\\) for a large number of values \\(n\\).\nIn this case \\(f(n)\\) is the number of operations used by Buble Sort, \\(g(n)=n^2\\) and \\(C=1.05\\).\nRead more about Big O notation and time complexity on\nthis page\n.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
