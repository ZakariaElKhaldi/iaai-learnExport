Another word for a parent node is\ninternal\nnode.\nA node can have zero, one, or many child nodes.\nA node can only have one parent node.\nNodes without links to other child nodes are called\nleaves\n, or\nleaf nodes\n.\nThe\ntree height\nis the maximum number of edges from the root node to a leaf node. The height of the tree above is 2.\nThe\nheight of a node\nis the maximum number of edges between the node and a leaf node.\nThe\ntree size\nis the number of nodes in the tree.\nTypes of Trees\nTrees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, used to represent hierarchical relationships. This tutorial covers several key types of trees.\nBinary Trees:\nEach node has up to two children, the left child node and the right child node. This structure is the foundation for more complex tree types like Binay Search Trees and AVL Trees.\nBinary Search Trees (BSTs):\nA type of Binary Tree where for each node, the left child node has a lower value, and the right child node has a higher value.\nAVL Trees:\nA type of Binary Search Tree that self-balances so that for every node, the difference in height between the left and right subtrees is at most one. This balance is maintained through rotations when nodes are inserted or deleted.\nEach of these data structures are described in detail on the \nDSA Exercises\nTest Yourself With Exercises\nExercise:\nIn a Tree data structure, like the one below:\nWhat are nodes C, D, E, and G called?\nNodes C, D, E, and G \nare called\nnodes.\nSubmit Answer \u00bb\nStart the Exercise\n\n\u2605\n+1",
