That is because in such a scenario, every new value must \"move through\" the whole sorted part of the array.\nThese are the operations that are done by the Insertion Sort algorithm for the first elements:\nThe 1st value is already in the correct position.\nThe 2nd value must be compared and moved past the 1st value.\nThe 3rd value must be compared and moved past two values.\nThe 3rd value must be compared and moved past three values.\nAnd so on..\nIf we continue this pattern, we get the total number of operations for \\(n\\) values:\n\\[1+2+3+...+(n-1)\\]\nThis is a well known series in mathematics that can be written like this:\n\\[ \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \\frac{n^2}{2} - \\frac{n}{2} \\]\nFor very large \\(n\\), the \\(\\frac{n^2}{2}\\) term dominates, so we can simplify by removing the second term \\(\\frac{n}{2}\\).\nUsing Big O notation, we get this time complexity for the Insertion Sort algorithm:\n\\[ O(\\frac{n^2}{2}) = O(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot n^2) = \\underline{\\underline{O(n^2)}} \\]\nThe time complexity can be displayed like this:\nAs you can see, the time used by Insertion Sort increases fast when the number of values is \\(n\\) increased.\nInsertion Sort Simulation\nUse the simulation below to see how the theoretical time complexity \\(O(n^2)\\) (red line) compares with the number of operations of actual Insertion Sorts.\nSet values:\n{{ this.userX }}\nRandom\nWorst Case\nBest Case\n10 Random\nOperations: {{ operations }}\n{{runBtnText}}\nClear\nFor Insertion Sort, there is a big difference between best, average and worst case scenarios. You can see that by running the different simulations above.\nThe red line above represents the theoretical upper bound time complexity \\(O(n^2)\\), and the actual function in this case is \\(1.07 \\cdot n^2\\).\nRemember that a function \\(f(n)\\) is said to be \\(O(g(n))\\) if we have a positive constant \\(C\\) so that \\(C \\cdot g(n)>f(n)\\).\nIn this case \\(f(n)\\) is the number of operations used by Insertion Sort, \\(g(n)=n^2\\) and \\(C=1.07\\).\n\n\u2605\n+1",
