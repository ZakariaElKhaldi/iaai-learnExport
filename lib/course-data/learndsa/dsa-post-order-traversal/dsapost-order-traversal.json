Read more about Binary Tree traversals in general\nhere\n.\nDoing a Post-order Traversal on a Binary Tree can be visualized like this:\nR\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nResult:\nPost-order Traverse\nPost-order Traversal works by recursively doing a Post-order Traversal of the left subtree and the right subtree, followed by a visit to the root node. It is used for deleting a tree, post-fix notation of an expression tree, etc.\nWhat makes this traversal \"post\" is that visiting a node is done \"after\" the left and right child nodes are called recursively.\nThis is how the code for Post-order Traversal looks like:\nExample\nPython:\ndef postOrderTraversal(node):\n    if node is None:\n        return\n    postOrderTraversal(node.left)\n    postOrderTraversal(node.right)\n    print(node.data, end=\", \")\nRun Example \u00bb\nThe\npostOrderTraversal()\nfunction keeps traversing the left subtree recursively (line 4), until\nNone\nis returned when C's left child node is called as the\nnode\nargument.\nAfter C's left child node returns\nNone\n, line 5 runs and C's right child node returns\nNone\n, and then the letter 'C' is printed (line 6).\nThis means that C is visited, or printed, \"after\" its left and right child nodes are traversed, that is why it is called \"post\" order traversal.\nThe\npostOrderTraversal()\nfunction continues to propagate back to \nThe function continues to propagate back and printing nodes until all nodes are printed, or visited.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
