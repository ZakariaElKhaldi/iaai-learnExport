      "content": "Unicode is a universal character set that defines all the characters needed for writing the majority\nof living languages in use on computers.\nUnicode aims to be (and already is) a superset of all other encoded computer character sets.\nThe Unicode Standard covers (almost) all characters, punctuations, and symbols in the \nworld and enables processing, storage, and transport of text independent of platform and language.\nThe Unicode Consortium\nThe Unicode Consortium develops the Unicode Standard.\nThe goal is to replace existing character sets with UTF (Unicode Transformation Format).\nThe Unicode Standard is implemented in \nHTML, XML, JavaScript, E-mail, PHP, Databases and in all modern operating systems and browsers.\nThe Unicode Character Sets\nUnicode can be implemented by different character sets. The most commonly used \nencodings are UTF-8 and UTF-16:\nCharset\nDescription\nUTF-8\nA variable-length character encoding (1 to 4 bytes long).\nUTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII and the preferred encoding for e-mail and web pages.\nUTF-16\nA variable-length character encoding.\nUTF-16 is used in all major operating systems like Windows, IOS, and Unix.\nThe first 128 characters of UTF-8 have the same binary values as ASCII, making \nASCII text valid UTF-8.\nThe HTML Standard is Unicode UTF-8\nThe default character set in HTML-4 (ISO-8859-1) were limited in size and not compatible in multilingual environments.\nThe default character encoding in HTML-5 is UTF-8.\nHTML5 pages using a different character set than UTF-8 must specify this a <meta> tag:\nExample\n<meta charset=\"ISO-8859-1\">\nThe Difference Between Unicode and UTF-8\nUnicode is a\ncharacter set\n.\nIt is a list where all characters have a unique decimal number:\nA\n=\n65\nB\n=\n66\nC\n=\n67\nD\n=\n69\nThe decimal numbers that represent the string \"hello\"is 104 101 108 108 111\nUTF-8 is\nencoding\n.\nIt is how unicode numbers are translated into binary numbers to be stored in the computer:\nUTF-8 encoding will store \"hello\" like this (binary): 01101000 01100101 01101100 \n01101100\u00a0 01101111\nUnicode is a\ncharacter set\n. It translates characters to numbers.\nUTf-8 is an\nencoding standard\n. It translates numbers into binary.\nHTML5 UTF-8 Character Codes\nBelow is a list of some of the UTF-8 character codes supported by HTML5:\nCharacter codes\nDecimal\nHexadecimal\nC0 Controls and Basic Latin\n0-127\n0000-007F\nC1 Controls and Latin-1 Supplement\n128-255\n0080-00FF\nLatin Extended-A\n256-383\n0100-017F\nLatin Extended-B\n384-591\n0180-024F\nLatin IPA\n592-685\n0250-02AD\nSpacing Modifiers\n688-767\n02B0-02FF\nDiacritical Marks\n768-879\n0300-036F\nGreek and Coptic\n880-1023\n0370-03FF\nCyrillic Basic\n1024-1279\n0400-04FF\nCyrillic Supplement\n1280-1327\n0500-052F\nGeneral Punctuation\n8192-8303\n2000-206F\nCurrency Symbols\n8352-8399\n20A0-20CF\nLetterlike Symbols\n8448-8527\n2100-214F\nNumber Forms\n8528-8591\n2150-218F\nArrows\n8592-8703\n2190-21FF\nMathematical Operators\n8704-8959\n2200-22FF\nBox Drawings\n9472-9599\n2500-257F\nBlock Elements\n9600-9631\n2580-259F\nGeometric Shapes\n9632-9727\n25A0-25FF\nMiscellaneous Symbols\n9728-9983\n2600-26FF\nDingbats\n9984-10175\n2700-27BF\nMisc Mathematical Symbols A\n10176-10223\n27C0-27EF\nSupplemental Arrows A\n10224-10239\n27F0-27FF\nBraille\n10240-10495\n2800-28FF\nSupplemental Arrows B\n10496-10623\n2900-297F\nMisc Mathematical Symbols B\n10624-10751\n2980-29FF\nSupplemental Math Operators\n10752-11007\n2A00-2AFF\nMisc Symbols and Arrows\n11008-11263\n2B00-2BFF\n\n\u2605\n+1",
