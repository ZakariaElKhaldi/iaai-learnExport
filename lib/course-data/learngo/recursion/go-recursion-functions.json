      "content": "Recursion Functions\nGo accepts recursion functions. A function is recursive if it calls itself \nand reaches a stop condition.\nIn the following example,\ntestcount()\nis a function that calls itself. We use the\nx\nvariable as the data, which \nincrements with 1 (\nx + 1\n) every time we recurse. The recursion ends when the\nx\nvariable equals to 11 (\nx == 11\n).\nExample\npackage main\nimport (\"fmt\")\nfunc testcount(x int) int {\nif x == 11 {\nreturn 0\n}\nfmt.Println(x)\nreturn testcount(x \n      + 1)\n}\nfunc main(){\ntestcount(1)\n}\nResult:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\nRecursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.\nThe developer should be careful with recursion functions as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.\nIn the following example,\nfactorial_recursion()\nis a function that calls itself. We use the\nx\nvariable as the data, which decrements (-1) every time we recurse. The recursion ends when the condition is not greater than 0 (i.e. when it is 0).\nExample\npackage main\nimport (\"fmt\")\nfunc factorial_recursion(x float64) (y float64) {\nif x > 0 {\ny = x * factorial_recursion(x-1)\n} else {\ny = 1\n}\nreturn\n}\nfunc main() {\nfmt.Println(factorial_recursion(4))\n}\nResult:\n24\n\nTo a new developer it can take some time to work out how exactly this works, best way to find out is by testing and modifying it.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
