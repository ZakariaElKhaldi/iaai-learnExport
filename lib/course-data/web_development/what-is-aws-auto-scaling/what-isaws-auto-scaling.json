Scaling policies can be unified for multiple AWS services together. Both Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and Application Auto Scaling services can be combined and included in AWS Auto Scaling.\nApplications are defined by AWS CloudFormation or by\nAWS Elastic Beanstalk\n.\nScaling plans can be customized to optimize for availability, cost, or both. Scaling policies can track performance metrics, like CPU usage, and will add or remove capacity to keep close to a target value for the metric.\nAWS Auto Scaling can predict application resource demand and create and provision capacity for:\nAmazon EC2\ninstances and spot fleets\nAmazon ECS tasks\nAmazon DynamoDB\ntable and indexes\nAmazon EMR instances\nAmazon Aurora\nreplicas\nAmazon AppStream 2.0 fleets\nAWS Auto Scaling Pricing\nAWS Auto Scaling is a free service, but extra service capacity is priced according to use.\n\n\u2605\n+1",
