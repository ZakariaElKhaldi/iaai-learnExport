It is the dominant programming language in web development.\nIn the beginning JavaScript was a language for the web client (browser).\nThen came the ability to use JavaScript on the web server (with Node.js).\nToday the hottest buzzword is \"Full Stack JavaScript\".\nThe idea of \"Full Stack JavaScript\" is that all software in a web application, both client side and server side,\nshould be written using JavaScript only.\n\u2714\nProgramming in C will slowly decline.\nProgramming in JavaScript will be more important.\nFull Stack JavaScript Developer\nA full stack JavaScript developer is a person who can develop both\nclient\nand\nserver\nsoftware.\nIn addition to mastering HTML and CSS, he/she also knows how to:\nProgram a\nbrowser\n(like using JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, or Vue)\nProgram a\nserver\n(like using Node.js)\nProgram a\ndatabase\n(like using MongoDB)\nClient Software\n(Front End)\nHTML\nCSS\nBootstrap\nW3.CSS\nJavaScript\nES5\nHTML DOM\nJSON\nXML\njQuery\nAngular\nReact\nBackbone.js\nEmber.js\nRedux\nStorybook\nGraphQL\nMeteor.js\nGrunt\nGulp\nServer Software\n(Back End)\nPHP\nASP\nC++\nC#\nJava\nPython\nNode.js\nExpress.js\nRuby\nREST\nGO\nSQL\nMongoDB\nFirebase.com\nSass\nLess\nParse.com\nPaaS (Azure and Heroku)\nFull Stack JavaScript Benefits\nCode reuse. Shared libraries, templates, and models.\nBest practice accumulated by 20 years of JavaScript.\nJavaScript is an evolving standard with a bright future.\nGood tutorials.
